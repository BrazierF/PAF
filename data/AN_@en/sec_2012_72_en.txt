Article 29 Working Party (WP 29): Data Protection Working Party established by Article 
29 of Directive 95/46/EC. It provides the European Commission with independent advice on 
data protection matters and supports the development of harmonised policies for data 
protection in the EU Member States. 
Binding corporate rules (BCR): Codes of practice based on European data protection 
standards, approved by at least one Data Protection Authority, which multinational 
organisations draw up and follow voluntarily to ensure adequate safeguards for transfers or 
categories of transfers of personal data between companies that are part of a same corporate 
group and that are bound by these corporate rules.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The centrepiece of EU legislation on data protection, Directive 95/46/EC1 (hereinafter "the 
Directive"), was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental 
right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member 
States. It was complemented by several instruments providing specific data protection rules in 
the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters2 (ex third pillar), including 
Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (hereinafter "the Framework Decision")3.  
Rapid technological and business developments have brought new challenges for the 
protection of personal data. The scale of data sharing and collecting has increased 
dramatically. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of 
personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Individuals 
increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has 
transformed both the economy and social life. 
Building trust in the online environment is key to economic development. Lack of trust 
makes consumers hesitate to buy online and adopt new services, including public e-
government services. If not addressed, this lack of confidence will continue to slow down the 
development of innovative uses of new technologies, to act as an obstacle to economic growth 
and to block the public sector from reaping the potential benefits of digitisation of its services, 
e.g. in more efficient and less resource intensive provisions of services. This is why data 
protection plays a central role in the Digital Agenda for Europe4, and more generally in the 
Europe 2020 Strategy5. 
The Lisbon Treaty defines the right to data protection as a principle of the EU and introduces 
a specific legal basis for the adoption of rules on the protection of personal data6 that also 
applies to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Article 8 of the EU’s Charter of 
Fundamental Rights (CFR) enshrines data protection as a fundamental right.  
The European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments 
on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative 
initiatives7. In its resolution on the Stockholm Programme, the European Parliament8 
welcomed a comprehensive data protection scheme in the EU and called for the revision of 
the Framework Decision among other measures.  
The Commission's broad public consultations and extensive stakeholder dialogues have 
confirmed that there is general agreement that the current framework remains sound as far as 
its objectives and principles are concerned. However, it has not prevented fragmentation in 
the way data protection is implemented across the Union, which causes legal uncertainty and 
a widespread public perception that there are significant privacy risks associated notably with 
online activity9.

This is why it is time to build a stronger and more coherent data protection framework in 
the EU, backed by strong enforcement that will allow the digital economy to develop across 
the internal market, put individuals in control of their own data and reinforce legal and 
practical certainty for economic operators and public authorities.  
The Commission highlighted the policy objectives of this reform in its Communication on a 
comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union adopted on 4 
November 201010. It is now translating these policy objectives into concrete reform proposals.  
This impact assessment focuses on the review of the Directive and the Framework Decision. 
The Commission will assess the need to adapt other legal instruments to the new general 
framework at a later stage11. 
2. PROCEDURAL ISSUES AND CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES 
2.1. Identification 
Title: Impact assessment on the reform of the data protection regulatory framework 
Lead DG: Justice 
Agenda planning number: AP 2010/279, CWP 2011 Annex 1 
2.2. Organisation and timing 
The evaluation and impact assessment process for the review of the personal data protection 
regulatory framework started with a general public consultation phase in May 2009. 
Evaluations of the Directive and of the Framework Decision were carried out by the 
Commission services in 2010 and 2011 (see below § 3.1 and annexes 2 and 3). Two external 
studies12 supported the evaluation and impact assessment. A specific report by the 
Commission evaluates the implementation of the Framework Decision by Member States.13  
The inter-service impact assessment steering group was convened for the first time on 3 
March 2010 and met again on 27 May 2010, 9 March 2011 and 14 July 2011. The following 
Commission services were invited to participate in the steering group: the Secretariat-General, 
the Legal Service, DG AGRI, DG AIDCO, DG COMM, DG COMP, DG EMPL, DG ENER, 
DG ESTAT, DG HOME, DG INFSO, DG JRC, DG MARKT, DG MOVE, DG OLAF, DG 
RTD, DG SANCO, DG TAXUD, DG TRADE and the EEAS.  
2.3. Consultation of the IAB  
Following the IAB opinion, the following changes were made to the present report: 
                                                 
10  COM(2010)609. The Commission's general approach was welcomed and the priorities set out in the Communication were largely 
supported by the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee. The European Parliament adopted 
an own initiative report (Report on a comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union, 
(2011/2025(INI)). The Council issued Conclusions on the Commission Communication (0371st JUSTICE and HOME AFFAIRS 
Council meeting, 24 and 25 February 2011). The EESC adopted  an opinion10 (Report on a comprehensive approach on personal 
data protection in the European Union, (2011/2025(INI)). 
11   See point 3 of the Communication COM(2010)609, p. 18.  
12  The studies were carried out, respectively, by GHK consulting and Trilateral Research. The first study was more comprehensive 
(from March 2010 to January 2011) while the second (May/June 2011) focused on the economic and social impacts of key 
measures.  
13  The implementation deadline of the Framework Decision was 27 November 2010. The implementation report is presented 
together with the reform proposals. 
 
EN 9   EN 
• The objectives of the current legal framework (to what extent they were achieved, to 
what extent they were not), as well as the objectives of the current reform, were 
clarified; 
• More evidence and additional explanations/clarification were added to the problems' 
definition section;  
• A section on proportionality was added; 
• All calculations and estimations related to administrative burden in the baseline 
scenario and in the preferred option have been entirely reviewed and revised 
(including Annex 9 on administrative burden calculations), and the relation between 
the costs of notifications and the overall fragmentation costs has been clarified; 
• Impacts on SMEs, particularly of DPOs and DPIAs have been better specified;  
• The analysis of impacts (especially economic ones, on competitiveness) has been 
improved; 
• The description of the options has been revised and clarified; 
• A table comparing the different options was added, as well as on the preferred 
option; 
• A new annex (n° 10) on competitiveness proofing of the preferred option was added.  
2.4. Consultation and expertise 
The evaluation included a broad-based consultation process, which lasted for more than two 
years and included two phases of public consultation. 
The first general public consultation was launched in May 2009 with a conference on personal 
data protection. The replies to the consultation and the summary of the results are available at: 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/news/consulting_public/news_consulting_0003_en.htm. A second 
public consultation was launched following the adoption of the Commission's Communication 
of 4 November 201014. A summary of the responses is included in annex 4. 
Targeted consultations were also conducted with key stakeholders; specific events were 
organised on 29 June 2010 with Member State authorities and on 1 July 2010 with private 
stakeholders, including private companies, as well as privacy and consumers' organisations.  
In November 2010, Vice-President Reding organised a roundtable on the data protection 
reform and on 28 January 2011 (Data Protection Day), the European Commission and the 
Council of Europe co-organised a High-Level Conference to discuss issues related to the 
reform of the EU legal framework as well as to the need for common data protection 
standards worldwide (http://www.data-protection-day.net/init.xhtml?event=36). Two 
Conferences on data protection were hosted by the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies of the 
Council on 16-17 June 2011 and on 21 September 2011 respectively.  
                                                 
14   http://ec.europa.eu/justice/news/consulting_public/news_consulting_0006_en.htm 
 
EN 10   EN 
Dedicated workshops and seminars on specific issues were held throughout 2011. On 24 
January ENISA (the European Network and Information Security Agency, dealing with 
security issues related to communication networks and information systems) organised a 
workshop on data breach notifications in Europe15. On 2 February the Commission convened 
a workshop with Member States' authorities to discuss the implementation of the Framework 
Decision and, more generally, data protection issues in the area of police cooperation and 
judicial cooperation in criminal matters. On 21-22 February the Fundamental Rights Agency 
held a stakeholder consultation meeting on "Data Protection and Privacy". A discussion on 
key issues of the reform was held on 13 July 2011 with national Data Protection Authorities.  
EU citizens were consulted through a Eurobarometer survey held in November-December 
201016.  
The "Article 29 Working Party" (WP29)17 provided several opinions and useful input to the 
Commission18. The EDPS also issued a comprehensive opinion on the issues raised in the 
Commission's November 2010 Communication19. 
A large majority of stakeholders agreed that the general principles remain valid but that there 
is a need to adapt the current framework in order to better respond to challenges posed by the 
rapid development of new technologies (particularly online) and increasing globalisation, 
while maintaining the technological neutrality of the Directive. Private sector data controllers 
in particular have underlined the need to increase harmonisation within the EU and to better 
apply the existing data protection principles in practice. Furthermore, they consider that the 
complexity of the rules on international transfers of personal data constitutes an 
impediment to their operations as they regularly need to transfer personal data from the EU to 
other parts of the world.  
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION 
3.1. Evaluation of the EU data protection framework 
The main and overarching objective of the current legal framework on data protection is to 
ensure a high level of data protection for all individuals in the EU.  
The Directive also aims at achieving an equivalent level of data protection in all Member 
States in order to ensure the free flow of information within the internal market. 
In the police and criminal justice area, a specific aim – enshrined in the Framework Decision 
– is to enhance mutual trust and thus support the exchange of personal data between 
police and judicial authorities.  
All these objectives, which remain entirely valid today, have only been partially achieved 
under the current legal framework.

17  WP29 was set up in 1996 (by Article 29 of the Directive) with advisory status and composed of representatives of national Data 
Protection Supervisory Authorities (DPAs), the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the Commission. For more

3/2010, WP 173);  on Applicable Law (n° 8/2010, WP 179); and on consent (n° 15/2011, WP 187). Upon the Commission's 
request, it adopted also the three following Advice Papers: on Notifications, on Sensitive Data and on Article 28(6) of the Data 
Protection Directive. They can all be retrieved at: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/workinggroup/wpdocs/2011_en.htm.

EN 11   EN 
As to the first objective, the Directive contains principles that are still sound and guarantee a 
high level of protection. However, there are today new challenges to the protection of 
personal data that could not be foreseen 16 years ago, when the Directive was adopted, 
linked to technological developments and globalisation. In particular, the development of the 
internet has greatly facilitated and increased the scale of data collecting and sharing, across 
geographical and virtual borders. The result is that personal data today may be processed 
more easily and on an unprecedented scale by both private companies and public authorities, 
which increases the risks for individuals' rights and challenges their capacity of keeping 
control over their own data (see Section 3.3., Problem 2 below). Moreover, there are wide 
divergences in the way Member States have transposed and enforced the Directive, so that in 
reality the protection of personal data across the EU cannot be considered as equivalent 
today. 
Differences in national transposition and enforcement have also limited the achievement of 
the "internal market objective" of the Directive, as highlighted already in the 2003 and 2007 
implementation reports20. Although there is no evidence that any Member State has ever 
blocked the flow of personal data to or from another Member State, these differences in 
approach have led to costly legal fragmentation and uncertainty with negative consequences 
for businesses, individuals and the public sector (see Section 3.2., Problem 1 below).  
The application of the EU data protection acquis in the area of police cooperation and 
judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in particular the Framework Decision, resulted in 
gaps and inconsistencies, which have affected both the level of protection for individuals and 
the mutual trust and cooperation between police and judicial authorities (see Section 3.4., 
Problem 3 below).  
3.2. PROBLEM 1 – Barriers for business and public authorities due to fragmentation, 
legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement 
3.2.1. Description of the problem  
The current divergences in the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of the 
Directive by Member States hamper the functioning of the internal market and cooperation 
between public authorities in relation to EU policies. This goes against the fundamental 
objective of the Directive of facilitating the free flow of personal data in the internal market. 
These divergences raise the compliance costs related to data processing and transfer 
operations between Member States, without any corresponding benefit in terms of data 
protection, and may discourage some economically or socially beneficial activities which 
would require cross-border transfers of data within the EU. It is estimated that the 
fragmentation of the legal framework gives rise to administrative burden costing EU firms 
close to € 3 billion per year.  
The rapid development of new technologies and globalisation further exacerbates this 
problem.  A comparative study on different approaches to new privacy challenges for the 
European Commission21 found that  
"We have seen dramatic technological change since the European Commission first 
proposed the Data Protection Directive in 1990. The Internet has moved out of the

university lab into 56% of European homes and 95% of OECD businesses. Computer 
processing power has continued to follow Moore’s Law, with transistor density 
doubling every 18-24 months – around one thousand-fold in the last two decades. 
Computer storage capacity and communications bandwidth have both been 
increasing even more quickly, doubling every 12 months and hence a thousand-fold 
each decade. These exponential increases have radically increased the ability of 
organisations to collect, store and process personal data. The physical environment 
is now saturated with sensors such as CCTV cameras and mobile phones, with 
biometric and electronic identifiers used to link data to individuals. In the digital 
world almost every communication and Web page access leaves behind detailed 
footprints. The Internet and mobile information appliances allow large quantities of 
personal data to be trivially moved between jurisdictions. Data mining tools attempt 
to find patterns in large collections of personal data, both to identify individuals “of 
interest” and to attempt to predict their interests and preferences. New multinational 
companies have sprung up around these technologies to service a global customer 
base, with smaller enterprises outsourcing employee and customer data processing 
to developing world companies." 
There are hardly any business transactions today which are not supported by information 
technology. Online transactions produce a trail of personal data by their very nature. With the 
introduction of loyalty cards and other systems, even day-to-day retail operations in normal 
supermarkets now leave a trail of personal data. Most travelling and leisure activities and 
service contracts have become unthinkable without the processing of personal data at a large 
scale. While for some traditional services, e.g. payment cards, the revenue from the collection 
and use of data has become more important than that from the actual consumer service, new 
business models have emerged that rely exclusively on this revenue source for their financing 
and profit, e.g. some search engines and social networking services monetizing their data 
through targeted advertising. 
Where these services are provided online, they are generally accessible regardless of the 
geographic location of user and service provider, and the operation of the service includes the 
transfer of personal data across borders. Large enterprises can afford the necessary legal 
expertise to ensure compliance with all relevant legislations and/or the technical efforts to 
ensure that their offering is adapted for each jurisdiction to the local requirements. Small and 
medium enterprises, on the contrary, do not have the resources for such expertise or 
adaptation and accordingly refrain from offering their services online altogether or choose to 
refuse servicing customers outside their national jurisdiction. While data protection legislation 
is not the only element contributing to these difficulties for businesses – others include 
intellectual property law, taxation and elements of civil law – it is one of the elements that 
need to be addressed in a comprehensive strategy to remove remaining obstacles in the digital 
single market, in line with the Commission's initiatives under the Stockholm Action Plan and 
the Digital Agenda for Europe. 
a) Fragmentation and legal uncertainty 
A first cause of the existing fragmentation of the legal framework on data protection is the 
fact that the Directive contains a number of provisions that are broadly formulated, and - 
sometimes intentionally - leave Member States significant room for manoeuvre in transposing 
them. For example, Article 5 of the Directive states that "Member States shall […] determine 
more precisely the conditions under which the processing of data is lawful". Furthermore, 
there is currently no strong mechanism to ensure a harmonised interpretation of the 
 
EN 13   EN 
Directive. The Commission’s implementing powers are limited to the external dimension of 
the Directive (transfers of data to third countries). The opinions of the Article 29 Working 
Party on questions covering "the application of the national measures adopted under this 
Directive in order to contribute to the uniform application of such measures"22 are not binding 
and are therefore not always followed in practice by DPAs. 
As a consequence, key provisions and concepts have been interpreted and transposed in quite 
different ways by Member States, so that the same processing is treated divergently across 
Member States and thus impacts cross-border processing activities by public authorities 
and businesses. This concerns, for example, the following issues23: 
- Consent: 
Consent is currently defined in the Directive as "any freely given specific and informed 
indication", of the data subject's wishes to give his/her agreement to the processing of 
personal data relating to him or her24 which must be "unambiguously given" in order to make 
the processing of personal data legitimate. National laws have transposed this concept quite 
differently and consequently national DPAs apply different interpretations of consent and of 
its modalities. In particular, the meaning of "unambiguously given" consent is interpreted in a 
variable manner: in some Member States, consent has to be given "expressly" and in some 
cases even in writing25, while other Member States and DPAs also accept some forms of 
implied consent26. The consequence is that a valid consent in one Member State would not be 
legally valid in others, therefore creating uncertainty amongst data controllers operating in 
several Member States on whether a data processing  is lawful or not. 
- Sensitive data27:  
"Sensitive data" are special categories of data (i.e., data revealing racial or ethnic origin, 
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and data 
concerning health or sex life) whose processing shall in principle be prohibited, unless certain 
conditions are fulfilled and safeguards provided.  
Some Member States have specified and added categories to those included in the Directive, 
for example biometric data (e.g. the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia) genetic data 
(Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg and Portugal) or party membership 
(Poland). Some Member States have also included data from the judiciary, for example 
information about previous convictions or criminal behaviour (e.g. Cyprus, the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland). On the other hand, some 
national laws do not consider as sensitive data on ethnic origin, political opinions or 
philosophical beliefs.  There is also a very varied  implementation – due to the room for 
manoeuvre left by the Directive in this respect – of the exceptions from the general 
prohibition of processing 'sensitive data'. For example, in relation to the possibility of 
processing health-related data (an exception to the general prohibition), some Member States

examples. 
24  Articles 2(h) and 7 (a) of the Directive. 
25  Express/explicit consent is required under the national laws of Cyprus, Germany, Greece and Italy, In addition, under German law 
consent has to be given in writing (with exceptions); under Italian law, consent has to be "documented in writing" as a general 
principle.

Act  1998 in relation to Use and disclosure of health data, retrievable at:

EN 14   EN 
(e.g. Cyprus and Denmark) allow this only when data are processed by health professionals, 
whereas in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia processing of such data is possible also for  
health insurance purposes. Also in this case, different requirements across Member States 
entail legal uncertainty and costs for both private (e.g. companies operating in the health 
sector) and public data controllers (on this aspect, see Section 3.2.2 b). 
-  Notification:  
Currently data controllers have the obligation to notify their processing operations to national 
DPAs, unless there are grounds for being exempted28. A large discretion is left to Member 
States in deciding possible exemptions to such obligation (and any other form of 
simplification), so that the same data processing activity could involve an obligation to notify 
the DPA in some Member States and not in others. For example, some Member States have 
made extensive use of the possibility for exemptions from the notification requirement by 
increasing the accountability of the data controller - in particular through the appointment of a 
Data Protection Officer (DPO)29 – while others make very limited exemptions. Moreover, 
several DPAs charge for notifications, whereas others do not (the charge for a single 
notification ranges from about €23 to €599 and may depend on whether  a data controller is a 
natural or legal person, public or private sector etc)30.  
All of this imposes costs and cumbersome procedures on business, without delivering any 
clear corresponding benefit in terms of data protection. All economic stakeholders have 
confirmed in the course of the public consultation that the current notification regime is 
unnecessarily bureaucratic and costly. DPAs themselves agree on the need to revise and 
simplify the current system31.  
This problem is made more acute by the current regime on applicable law as established by 
the Directive32, which allows for a "cumulative" and simultaneous application of different 
national laws to a same data controller established in several Member States. This means that 
such controller will have to comply with the different national laws, obligations and varied 
requirements that apply for each of its establishments. It is important to note that the notion of 
"establishment", as confirmed by the opinion of the Article 29 Working Party on the issue33, 
has generally been interpreted broadly by DPAs. In practice even an attorney office, a one-
man office or a simple agent in a Member State are often considered as an "establishment", 
and thus lead to the application of the national laws of the Member States concerned.  
This means that the fragmentation – and the costs linked to that (see Section 3.2.2 below) - 
caused by diverging national requirements combined with the simultaneous application of 
national laws affects not only large enterprises with physical establishment/branches in 
Member States but most of the companies carrying out cross-border activities. 
 Example 1 below helps to show how these costs arise. 
 
                                                 
28  See Articles 18 and 19 of the Directive. 
29  DPOs exist today in several Member States (Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Estonia and Hungary), 
with  variable status and competences. Their appointment is optional in most Member States, except in Germany - where this is a 
compulsory obligation for public data controllers and for private controllers permanently employing at least 10 persons in the 
automated processing of personal data or when the processing is subject to prior checking - + Hungary and Slovakia?.

Example 1 34: Legal complexity and cost of notifications for a data controller processing 
personal data in 15 Member States 
A chain of shops has its head office in Member State X and franchised shops in 14 other Member 
States. Data relating to clients are collected in every shop, but are transferred to the head office in 
Member State X where some activities related to the processing of data take place (e.g. targeted 
advertising). The data protection law of Member State X would therefore be applicable to the 
processing activities carried out by the head office. However, the individual shops remain 
responsible for processing of their customers' personal data, which take place in the context of 
the shops' activities (for example, the collection of customers' personal data). To the extent that 
processing is carried out in the context of each shop's activities, it is subject to the law of the 
Member State where that shop is established. This means that each shop must notify its personal 
data processing operations to the national DPA according to the data protection law of the 
Member State where the shop is established, if notification is required by that law. The head 
office in Member State X and the individual shops in the other Member States could therefore be 
faced with the following scenario regarding notifications:  
- Five Member States exempt all data controllers from notification requirements except in cases 
of sensitive data processing; hence the shops established in those five Member States do not have 
to notify their data processing operations.  
- Member State X and four additional Member States A, B, C and D oblige all data controllers to 
notify processing operations and charge a fee of €300. The head office and the shops established 
in those five Member States have to notify the Data Protection Authority (DPA) in the Member 
State where they are established. 
- Three Member States E, F and G exempt data controllers from notifications only if they have 
appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO). If not, they have to notify and pay a charge of €150. 
The shops in these Member States have not appointed a DPO and therefore they have to notify 
their operations. 
- Member State H obliges data controllers to notify processing only when processing is done 
through automated means and charges a fee of €500. The shop has to notify. 
- Member State I obliges all data controllers to notify and charges a fee of €25. 
In all cases where the shops have to notify the data processing operations in accordance with 
national data protection rules, the head office of the company has to consult a local lawyer to 
ensure legal compliance. Taking an average legal cost across the EU of €250/hour and assuming 
four hours of legal work per Member State, excluding the Member States that do not oblige data 
controllers to notify processing, the company would incur a cost of €10,000 in order to obtain 
legal advice. Including the notification fees for the processing activities in Member States X and 
A-I, the total costs of the notification requirement would be €12,475. 
 
The overall cost of notifications – only in terms of administrative burden - is of 
approximately €130 million per year (see Annex 9 for details). In addition to the 
administrative burden, other direct and indirect costs of the requirement and its fragmentation 
have to be taken into account. This includes, inter alia, direct fees for notifications collected 
by some data protection authorities. 
Notifications are, however, only one procedural element illustrating the effect of 
fragmentation with particular clarity, but by far not the most important one in terms of 
                                                 
34  Based on the example in WP29 Opinion on Applicable Law, p.15.

its economic effect. A more detailed estimation of the overall effects of fragmentation is 
provided in Annex 9. 
Fragmentation also negatively affects efficiency and effectiveness of public authorities as 
explained under Section 3.2.2 b) below. 
- Transfers to third countries 
Divergent approaches in the transposition of the Directive also apply to the provisions on 
transfers to third countries, which are additionally challenged by the increasingly globalised 
nature of data flows (i.e. the fact that personal data are being transferred across a large 
number of virtual and geographical borders, such as in the framework of "cloud computing"). 
This is illustrated by the following: 
a) Adequacy: 
One of the criteria for transferring personal data to a third country is that the latter provides 
for an 'adequate' level of protection in relation to the data being transferred35. Currently, the 
decision on such adequate level of protection of a third country may be taken either by the 
Commission – in which case all Member States are bound by it - or by Member States 
themselves. In the latter case, some Member States allow the data controller itself to conduct 
the adequacy check (e.g. the UK), while others reserve it for national authorities, in particular 
the DPAs (e.g. France). This leads to a situation whereby transfers towards a certain third 
country may be considered lawful (as the level of data protection is considered to be 
adequate) in a Member State but not in others, and thus creates legal uncertainty for data 
controllers operating in more than one Member State that want to transfer data lawfully to a 
third country. 
b) "Standard contractual clauses":  
These are standard data protection clauses, established by Commission Decisions, to be 
included in contracts that allow data transfers from a data controller established in the EU to 
data controllers and processors in third countries36. Although Member States are under the 
obligation to recognise the standard contractual clauses approved by the Commission as 
fulfilling the requirements laid down by the Directive for the transfer of data to a third country 
- and can thus not refuse the transfer - some of them still require their national DPAs to 
review them and give their prior authorisation to the transfer. In such cases, data controllers 
are subject to unnecessary and varied requirements/authorisations, in spite of the 
establishment of model clauses aimed at facilitating the transfers while ensuring the necessary 
guarantees in terms of protection.  
c) "Binding Corporate Rules" (BCRs): 
"Binding Corporate Rules" (BCRs) are internal rules followed by a multinational corporation 
for transfers of personal data between the groups of companies belonging to the same 
multinational corporation, approved by one (or more) DPAs. BCRs have been developed as a 
matter of practice by DPAs and by the WP2937 on the basis of an extensive interpretation of 
Article 25(2) of the Directive, in order to facilitate data transfers within multinationals 
operating worldwide. In such cases, if the transfers had to be regulated via contractual clauses 
(standard or not), this would require the conclusion of a myriad of contracts between the 
                                                 
35  See Article 25 of the Directive. 
36  See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm#h2-3. 
37 WP29 adopted several opinions on BCRs available at:

EN 17   EN 
different entities of the group, which would have to follow the requirements provided for 
under the different national laws applicable. This type of situation can be avoided via the use 
of BCRs, which are therefore recognised as a useful tool by economic stakeholders, 
particularly by companies operating across several Member States and third countries. There 
are, however, some shortcomings that currently discourage companies from using them38, 
such as: 
-  not all Member States and DPAs recognise the decisions taken by other DPAs and impose 
additional national requirements. The so-called "mutual recognition procedure" – whereby 
BCRs are reviewed and approved only by the "lead DPA", assisted by two other concerned 
DPAs39 -  is currently accepted only by 17 Member States plus the 3 EEA countries; 
- the length of the current procedure for recognising/approving BCRs: six months as an 
average, but up to two years in complex cases and even longer when several authorisations 
are required according to national law; 
- BCRs are currently limited to data controllers and do not cover data processors40; 
- the uncertainty about the possibility of applying BCRs to "groups of companies", because 
there is no clear definition of what this would cover.      
According to feedback from stakeholders, particularly large enterprises, the above situation is 
an obstacle to business operations and reduces the attractiveness of the EU as a business 
location, as companies regularly need to transfer personal data from EU Member States to 
other world regions. 
b) Inconsistent enforcement of data protection rules across the EU 
In the 2003 implementation report of the Directive, the Commission considered enforcement 
as one of the problematic issues – mainly due to the limited resources of DPAs and to their 
non-prioritisation of enforcement tasks - stressing that "more vigorous and effective 
enforcement" was needed to improve compliance with the legislation. "Closer cooperation 
among the supervisory authorities" was also seen as a means – as an alternative to the revision 
of the Directive – to remedy the divergences between Member States' laws.  
However, as confirmed by a comprehensive report issued recently by the Fundamental Rights 
Agency41, the situation has not really improved since then.    
– Limited resources available to DPAs 
First of all, there are still important variations in the level of funding of data protection 
authorities and the resources available to them.  Some DPAs are still under-resourced42 and 
have thus difficulties in handling all complaints they receive, in carrying out enforcement 
actions and in cooperating effectively with other DPAs43.  
                                                 
38  Based on information provided by WP29, 14 BCRs have been approved by DPAs so far, about 25 companies have provided 
DPAs with a first draft of BCRs and another 26 are being prepared. According to stakeholders' feedback, only the biggest 
companies can afford to adopt BCRs, due to the complexity of the procedure and the related costs, which are € 20,000 on average 
but can amount – for very large companies with many subsidiaries - to €1 million. 
39  For the criteria currently used to determine the "lead DPA"  see Working Document WP107 of  WP29.  
40  More specifically, BCRs can be used currently for transfers  of personal data that is originally processed by the company as 
controller withint he same corporate group (such as data related to customers, employees) and not allowing the use of BCRs for 
data originally processed in the group as processor (such as processing made in the context of outsourcing services). 
41  See the 2010 study on Data Protection in the European Union: the role of National Data Protection Authorities, available at 
 http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Data-protection_en.pdf . See also Annex 2 for more details. 
42  This is the case, for instance,  in  Austria, Romania and Slovakia. 
43  A letter was also sent to the Commission in July 2011 by the Chair of WP29 highlighting the financial difficulties of certain 
DPAs, which would limit their participation in WP29 meetings. 
 
EN 18   EN 
– Different powers of national DPAs 
Secondly, in some Member States the "effective powers of intervention" of DPAs as required 
by the Directive44 are limited: for example, not all DPAs have the power to stop processing 
(e.g. BE), order the destruction or erasure of data (e.g., BE, DE, SE), access data banks and 
filing systems (e.g. UK) or to refer/bring the case before the judicial authorities (e.g., EE). 
Equally, not all DPAs have the power to impose fines on data controllers (e.g. BE, DK, LT, 
HU, AT, PL, SE); when fines are foreseen, their amount also varies considerably (see Annex 
2 for details). In some cases, DPAs may only negotiate amicable solutions with those having 
violated the law or to refer them to courts (e.g., BE). Finally, some DPAs appear not to act 
with "complete independence" as required by Article 28(1) of the Directive and interpreted by 
the Court of Justice45. This means that the effective level of data protection varies across the 
EU, with the consequence that EU citizens’ fundamental rights – the right to privacy, for 
example – may in practice differ from one Member State to the next. 
– Lack of effective cooperation between DPAs and absence of regulatory powers 
for the European Commission 
The Directive establishes a general duty of mutual cooperation and information exchange 
between national supervisory authorities46. However, as highlighted by DPAs themselves, 
practical cooperation between national supervisory authorities in cross-border cases can and 
should be improved47. 
Moreover, existing non-binding mechanisms and structures to ensure DPAs cooperation and 
to contribute to the "uniform application" of national laws on data protection – the Article 29 
Working Party (WP29), in particular - are deficient in this regard48. While the WP29, and 
advisory body to the Commission49, regularly adopts opinion on the interpretation of different 
provisions of the Directive to help uniform application, these are not binding and are not 
always followed by DPAs50.  
In addition, the fact that the Commission also ensures the secretariat of the WP2951 leads to 
uncertainties as to the demarcation between the role of the Commission as an Institution, on 
the one hand, and its role as secretariat, on the other. For example, while the Directive states 
that WP29 "[shall] act independently", some of its opinions - largely publicised in the press – 
have been perceived by some stakeholders as being "the Commission's view (or 
interpretation)" of a certain matter related to the Directive52. This misperception can be 
particularly problematic in cases where the opinions openly criticise EU policies53. On the 
other side, WP29 tends to consider that its independence can be undermined by the fact that 
the Commission provide for its secretariat and determine the available resources. 
                                                 
44  See Article 28(3), second indent. 
45  The Commission has launched infringement procedures to address this issue: see in particular the recent judgement by the 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Case-C-518/07, Commission and EDPS vs. Germany. An infringement procedure on the same 
ground was launched against Austria in 2010; the situation in other Member States is currently being examined. 
46  See Article 28(6).   
47  See their Advice Paper on Article 28(6), cit., footnote 18.  
48  The result of a survey carried out by the Commission with Member States showed that few of them have in one or two occasions 
modified their law following an opinion of the WP29 (see annex 2 for more details).  
49  Its members are national DPAS, the EDPS and the Commission (the latter without voting rights). 
50  The result of a survey carried out by the Commission with Member States showed that few of them have in one or two occasions 
modified their law following an opinion of the WP29 (see annex 2 for more details).  
51  WP29 website is also hosted on the Europa server http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/index_en.htm. 
52 See for example the – quite controversial - opinion on behavioural advertising (Opinion 2/2010): 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2010/wp171_en.pdf.,  
53            See for example WP29 Opinion 10/2011 on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the use 
of passenger name record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime:  
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2011/wp181_en.pdf. 
 
EN 19   EN 
The result of the above is that the existing governance system often leads to divergent 
decisions of DPAs vis-à-vis the same data controller for the same data processing, i.e. there is 
currently no "one-stop shop" for data controllers. This adds further to the uncertainty and 
costs faced by companies. No single DPA has a complete overview of the processing 
activities of companies that are established (or, if based outside the EU, have appointed a 
representative) in several Member States and are subject to different national laws as well as 
to the "jurisdiction" of different DPAs.  
This clearly does not help addressing, and on the contrary exacerbates, the problem of legal 
fragmentation at EU level and prevents an effective and consistent handling of cases where 
the right to data protection is affected on a European – if not global – scale.  
Example 2 below illustrates the difficulties in ensuring a common and consistent European 
approach in enforcing the rules vis-à-vis data controllers affecting personal data across the 
EU and highlights the limits of the current enforcement model, as well as the lack of 
satisfactory cooperation between national DPAs.  
Example 2: Different approaches towards online mapping services 
A multinational company with several establishments in EU Member States has recently deployed an 
online navigation and mapping system across Europe. This system collects images of all private and 
public buildings, and may also take pictures of individuals.  
The data protection safeguards applied to this service and thus the requirements imposed upon data 
controllers vary substantially from one Member State to another. Depending on the Member States 
and on their implementation of the notification requirements into national law, a notification may or 
may not be required for this system. In one Member State, the deployment of this service led to a 
major public and political outcry, and some aspects of it were considered to be unlawful. This 
concerned, for example, the inclusion of un-blurred pictures of persons entirely unaware that they 
were being photographed. The company then offered additional guarantees and safeguards to the 
individuals residing in that Member State after negotiation with the competent DPA. However the 
company refused to commit to offer the same additional guarantees to individuals in other Member 
States facing similar problems. Whereas in some Member States the company was sanctioned, in other 
Member States the DPAs considered that such a navigation or mapping system was in line with data 
protection requirements. The WP29 attempted, unsuccessfully, to coordinate the different DPAs 
positions so as to have a common EU approach and ensure a consistent enforcement of the rules vis-à-
vis data controllers and individuals. 
3.2.2. Who is affected and to what extent? 
a) Economic operators 
As the Directive leads to the simultaneous application of national laws where the controller is 
established in several Member States, data controllers operating across borders need to 
spend time and money (for legal advice, to prepare the required forms/documents etc) to 
comply with different, and sometimes contradictory, obligations, such as the different 
requirements for notifications of data processing to DPAs. According to stakeholders' 
feedback, the data controller has to bear an administrative burden estimated to correspond to 
around €200 per (new) notification to the DPA, without including the notification fees 
charged by the DPA itself. This leads to an overall administrative burden of € 130 million per 
year due to notifications requirements (see Annex 9 for details). In addition to the 
administrative burden, other direct and indirect costs of the requirement and its fragmentation 
have to be taken into account. This includes, inter alia, direct fees for notifications collected 
by some data protection authorities. 
 
EN 20   EN 
As highlighted above, notifications are only one procedural element illustrating the effect 
of fragmentation with particular clarity, but by far not the most important one in terms 
of its economic effect. A more detailed estimation of the overall effects of fragmentation is 
provided in Annex 9. 
The administrative burden resulting from the fragmentation within the EU internal 
market is estimated at about € 2.9 billion per annum54, accounting for about half of the 
overall administrative burden linked to the Directive (i.e. about  € 5,3 billion). These 
estimates are based on the Standard Cost Model and do not take account of compliance costs 
other than "administrative burden" (for example, to adapt to variable security requirements in 
different Member States). These additional compliance costs are, however, difficult to 
quantify given the variety of requirements across Member States.   
To give an idea of overall compliance costs born by large and very large companies, a recent 
study - concerning companies based both inside and outside Europe55 - estimates that each of 
these large multinational companies spends as an average €2.5 million per year on overall 
compliance with various data protection obligations (including administrative burden and 
other costs). A large part of these compliance costs are due to the fragmentation of national 
data protection rules - within the EU and beyond - and also cover compliance obligations non-
data protection related. The same study concludes that the cost of non-compliance for such 
companies is much higher56. 
However, fragmentation is not only a problem for large, multinational enterprises. On the 
contrary, the complex situation on the ground deriving from diverging and sometimes 
conflicting data protection requirements at national level also constitutes a disincentive for all 
enterprises operating in the internal market from expanding their operations cross-border or 
establishing in more than one Member State. This problem thus concerns all EU businesses, 
including micro-enterprises and SMEs: this complexity leads to significant costs in terms of 
legal fees if they consider expanding their operations cross-border, and often acts as a 
disincentive from so doing. The outcome is that they do not reap the advantages of the 
internal market, with subsequent impacts on the EU economy, competition within the EU, and 
competitiveness in general.  
b) Public authorities 
Differences between Member States in implementing and interpreting the Directive also 
create difficulties for public authorities. It is difficult to estimate the costs, including the 
administrative burden, born by public authorities. Moreover, given the nature of their 
activities – generally addressed, in most cases, to individuals residing in the Member State of 
origin - they are likely to be only marginally affected by fragmentation. 
However, fragmentation is relevant to the extent that it affects cooperation between national 
authorities aiming at attaining common EU objectives, for example in the area of public 
health57.  
                                                 
54  This figure does not include the administrative burden for companies established outside the EU to which – due to the current

One way of ensuring health protection is to produce information on health indicators and 
trends at EU level to compare national public health between Member States, identify health 
problems common to Member States and trace their causes, inform EU policy on health and 
take decisions based on evidence. Health data are considered sensitive under the Directive. 
Their processing for monitoring public health is only allowed in specific situations, in 
particular where consent is given by data subjects or for the purposes of preventive medicine, 
medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the management of healthcare 
services or where Member States deem processing necessary due to substantial public 
interest. Since the Directive does not harmonise the rules for the processing of data 
specifically for public health purposes, Member States' practices vary greatly. As illustrated in 
the examples below, this lack of harmonisation and divergent national implementation affects 
cooperation between national authorities aiming at attaining common EU objectives. 
Example 3: Divergent practices as a barrier to EU public health cooperation   
Two examples of difficulties in pursuing public health policies due to divergences in data protection 
requirements are cancer registries and contact tracing. In the first case, some Member States require 
the "prior informed consent" of individuals regarding the reporting of cancer incidence and mortality 
data, whereas other Member States have different requirements. The consequence of these differences 
is that cancer registries cannot operate in some Member States, or in some cases, the registries even 
collapse, and the reporting and comparison of cancer incidence across the EU is not sufficiently 
reliable.  
In the second case, the collection of data on communicable diseases for contact tracing from entities 
concerned by travel activities for public health purposes, is not effectively conducted within the EU 
because some Member States have established diverging conditions for the processing of such data. 
This problem was particularly acute, for instance, during the H1N1 flu pandemic. 
c) Individuals 
Legal uncertainty and complexity have a chilling effect of on the preparedness of businesses, 
in particular SMEs, to offer their services across borders or online at all. This reduces the 
choice of offerings for consumers and the competition in the market. The potential benefits of 
the online single market are only available to a limited extent. At the same time, legal 
uncertainty also affects directly the willingness of consumers to make use of online services 
and in particular cross border services. Concerns about privacy and data protection are one of 
the factors that act as obstacles to the full development of the online single market. 
3.3. PROBLEM 2 – Difficulties for individuals to stay in control of their personal data 
3.3.1. Description of the problem  
Individuals enjoy different data protection rights, due to fragmentation and inconsistent 
implementation and enforcement in different Member States. Furthermore, individuals are 
often neither aware nor in control of what happens to their personal data and therefore fail to 
exercise their rights effectively.  
Globalisation and technological developments, particularly the fact that personal data are 
nowadays being transferred across an increasing number of virtual and geographical borders 
in the online economy, including through "cloud computing", further challenge the control 
individuals may keep over their own data.  
 
EN 22   EN 
a) Insufficient awareness, loss of control and trust, particularly in the online environment  
In the online environment, it is increasingly difficult for individuals to be aware of the 
processing of the data related to them and the risks linked to such processing, to maintain 
control over their own data and, ultimately, to assert their rights vis-à-vis data controllers.  
Two thirds of European citizens feel that the disclosure of personal data is a major concern for 
them and six in ten citizens consider that nowadays there is no alternative to disclosing 
personal data in order to obtain products and services58. Three quarters of citizens feel that 
they have either no or only partial control of their personal data on social networking sites59. 
– Insufficient awareness and underestimation of privacy risks 
In order to be in control, individuals need to be aware by whom, on what grounds, from 
where, for what purposes, and for how long their personal data are being processed and what 
their rights are in relation to the processing. Currently, the duty to inform the data subject 
does not cover each of these elements; and even when sufficient information is available, it is 
often not understandable for the individual60.  
A 2008 survey61 revealed that on average in the EU only 41% of data controllers maintain and 
update privacy policy notices. This percentage is even lower for SMEs62.

When they are provided, online privacy policy notices ("Privacy Statements") are often 
overly complex, making use of technical and legal terminology. This complexity is reflected 
in the responses to a 2011 Eurobarometer survey: close to six in ten internet users claim they 
read privacy policies (58%), but only a third say that they read them and understand them 
(34%); a quarter say that they read them but do not fully understand them (24%). A quarter

http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_226_en.pdf ("EB 2008" in future references).  
62  The consultation of SMEs (see Annex 8)  showed that only 36.3% of respondents have a privacy policy on their company's 
website. Furthermore, 48.6% of SMEs state that they have been providing information to data subjects, as required by data 
protection laws, but only 27.4% of them state that they always provide this information. More than 21% of respondents state that 
they never provide such information to data subjects.

say they do not read them (25%), one in twenty say they do not know where to find them 
(5%) and almost one in ten ignore privacy statements (8%).63 
The lack of readily available and easily understandable information makes it difficult for 
individuals to become aware of the risks linked to the use of their personal data and take the 
necessary measures to ensure their own protection. For instance, almost half of the 
respondents to a recent Eurobarometer do not feel sufficiently informed on social networking 
and file sharing sites64. 
This is particularly relevant with respect to children, who tend to underestimate the risks and 
consequences of making their personal data available online. A recent survey funded under 
the Safer Internet programme65 shows that 38% of children aged between 9 and 12 and 77% 
of 13-16 year olds have a profile on a social network site (SNS)66 even though the privacy 
policies of most social networking sites prohibit this. A quarter of 9-12 year olds have their 
profile as 'public', displaying in some cases private information such as their address and/or 
phone number to all other users. 
– Loss of control and trust 
As confirmed by a recent Eurobarometer survey67, profiling, data mining, and technological 
developments that ease the exchangeability of personal data make it even more important for 
individuals to be in control of their personal data. The graph below shows the extent to which 
individuals feel in control of their personal data online. 
  
 
In a recent Eurobarometer survey, 75% of respondents that owned an account on a social 
networking site and 80% of online shoppers consider that they have no or only partial control 
over their personal data. 70% of them are concerned that economic operators processing their 
personal data may use it for a different purpose than the one they were collected for68.

In relation to profiling, the Directive grants individuals the right not to be subject to a 
decision which is based solely on automated processing of data intended to evaluate personal 
aspects of the data subject. This safeguard only applies to decisions based "solely" on 
automated processing so that there is a risk that it is easily circumvented by including a 
merely formal human intervention in the decision process which has no influence on its 
outcome. Examples for such procedures include the conditions of a telephone service or 
insurance contract, where conditions and tariffs are adjusted on the basis of a scoring of the 
potential customers on the basis of general and individual data related to him or her. While 
the decision to make a specific offer is formally with the sales staff, this person's decision is 
defined by the outcome of an automated system so that he or she effectively has no margin of 
decision to deviate from that suggestion. In the specific case of behavioural advertising69, 
54% of Europeans feel uncomfortable with practices which involve online profiling and a 
large majority of them (74%) would like to be given the opportunity to give (or refuse) their 
specific consent before the collection and processing of their personal data70.  
With current technologies it is possible to collect and process personal data anywhere, at any 
time and in many different forms. For instance, mobile devices can nowadays easily obtain 
information about the geographical location of individuals in real time by many different 
technological means71. Services based on location information are considered one of the most 
dynamic areas for innovation. Location based services can provide considerable benefits to 
individuals, from improved real-time routing algorithms which consider traffic density and 
congestions and provide faster and more fuel-efficient routes than static systems, over faster 
dispatching of emergency services based on accurate real-time location information, to 
advertising services in the immediate vicinity of the requesting individual. The possibilities 
for using location information as parameters in services such as search, social networking or 
other web 2.0 services are still being explored. On the other hand, location information may 
be retained to create motion profiles of individuals containing information about their each 
and every move at a level of detail and for a period far beyond what individuals would 
remember themselves. Divergent application of data protection rules would not only hamper 
the development of useful services, but would also reduce citizens' willingness to use existing 
services when they fear becoming subject of constant monitoring of their lives. 
When using online services, individuals are associated with technical (online) identifiers 
provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols72 and leave traces of their activity 
at each server they communicate with. This interaction log and other information received by 
the servers, e.g. time and contact of interaction, location data etc, can build a very detailed 
trace of an individual's online activity. Even without a name or other traditional identifying 
attribute, it is often possible to effectively identify the individual to whom the data relates. 
However, legal practice in Member States differs as to the assessment of identifiability of 
such online data collections (and hence whether to consider such data as personal data) and 
thereby leaves individuals with uncertainty and effective impossibility to assert their rights 
regarding the fastest growing and most comprehensive collections of data about their 
                                                 
69   This is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. Behavioural 
targeting uses information collected on an individual's web-browsing behaviour, such as the pages they have visited or the 
searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual. This allows site owners or ad networks to 
display advertising content which is considered to be more relevant to the interests of the individual viewing the page. On the 
theory that properly targeted ads will generate more consumer interest, the web site publisher and advertising agency may charge 
a higher price for these advertisements than for random advertising or ads based on the context of a site.

behaviour. While some Member States recognise the sensitivity of such data and provide for 
clear rules on the use and retention of usage data, others do not provide for legal provisions 
addressing this issue, leaving the application of data protection principles to decision on a 
case by case basis.  
The fact that important data controllers operating in the digital/online market are established 
outside the EU makes it even more challenging for individuals to keep control over their own 
data in such cases and to effectively exercise their rights. The practical application of the 
criteria provided by the Directive on whether and when EU laws are applicable to processing 
of personal data by controllers established outside the EU/EEA is currently subject of 
considerable discussion. Member States apply different interpretations regarding the "use of 
equipment" on the territory of Member States73. Other relevant issues of interpretations 
concern the identification of the actual data controller and the distinction between controllers 
and processors. Moreover, even in cases where the applicability of EU legislation is 
established, enforcement of data protection laws and administrative measures and decisions 
remains problematic. Even when parts of the equipment used for processing are located 
within the EU, EU based authorities usually have no means to enforce decisions or sanctions 
on entities whose main establishment is outside the territory of their jurisdiction. They may 
also meet difficulties to enforce the basic requirement for the establishment of an EU 
representative by data controllers not established in the EU but subject to EU legislation. In 
particular in cases where services are clearly customized to address citizens of a specific EU 
Member State, by using the county's languages and adapting to its cultural preferences and 
obtaining revenue from advertising local brands, products and services, it is usually not even 
possible for the citizen to recognize that by using such services they are entrusting their 
personal data to a data controller which may not effectively be subject to the adequate data 
protection legislation. 
Where personal data is collected by an entity established in the EU which is part of an 
international group or acts on behalf of a main service provider outside the EU, provision of 
services is often based on the transfer of most or all personal data collected to processing 
facilities outside the EU. In principle, such transfers to third countries are subject to 
conditions which shall ensure that appropriate data protection safeguards are observed by the 
receiving entity in a third country. From an individual's perspective, it is important to know 
whether the controller – e.g. as a provider of a service on the web – complies with the 
conditions and legal requirements, and how to obtain support in case of a suspected breach of 
the rules. 
– Data breaches 
The increased number of data breaches of large companies’ customer databases is an 
additional factor undermining individuals' trust and confidence. As shown by the example 
below, these security failures may lead to harmful consequences for individuals, ranging from 
undesired spam to identity theft74. In the context of the SME consultation, in relation to data 
breaches, 7.1% of respondents have recently experienced a breach (of which 55% actually 
informed the individuals whose data were affected by breaches) and indicated a cost of less 
than €500 for the notification (see Annex 8 for details). 
Example 4: Recent data breach case putting data subjects' personal data at risk 
                                                 
73  See WP29 opinion on applicable law on this matter, cit. footnoie 18, pp. 18-25 
74 Interesting figures on recent data breaches and losses can be found at: http://datalossdb.org (data not verified).   
 
EN 26   EN 
One recent prominent case of data breach was that of a gaming service, in which according to media 
reports tens of million user accounts were compromised by hackers, including users' names, addresses 
and possibly credit card data. A further problem in this case was the fact that the data controller 
delayed the notification of the breach to data subjects by one week after the breach in the security of 
the network had been discovered. This attracted additional criticism by users, and prompted questions 
on whether there needed to be explicit deadlines within which a data controller must notify a data 
breach to data subjects and supervisory authorities.  
 
Individuals react on the increase of data breaches with raising concern. The percentage of 
individuals that would want to be informed when their personal data is lost, stolen or altered 
in any way is constantly increasing and has reached the level of 88% EU wide75. At present, 
EU wide harmonised rules on the notification for data breaches exist only for the electronic 
communications sector, which are still being implemented by many Member States following 
the 2009 Telecom Reform. For other sectors, some Member States have implemented rules at 
national level through different legal instruments (laws, regulations, guidance by the DPA, 
but no harmonised rules have been established so far. Increasing pressure to establish such 
rules could move national legislators to adopting national legislation on breach notifications. 
This could create the risk of increased divergence between Member States on this aspect. 
– Fragmentation 
Individuals’ confidence and trust is already weakened by the fragmentation, legal 
uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement of data protection rules across Member States. The 
same individual, travelling to another Member State or shopping cross-border on the internet, 
would see his/her rights, and the way of exercising them, vary significantly depending on the 
applicable national legislation. Thus, individuals, even if they are aware of the data protection 
provided by their own Member States, often do not know how to exercise their data protection 
rights when their personal data are processed across several Member States. This is an 
additional factor reducing their readiness to shop for goods and services from other 
Member States.  
According to the Digital Agenda for Europe, a lack of trust in the online environment is 
hampering the development of Europe's online economy. A recent Eurostat survey shows that 
privacy and trust concerns are amongst the top reasons preventing people from buying 
online76. Among people who did not order online in 2009, the top reasons were: payment 
security concerns, privacy concerns, and trust concerns.

b) Difficulties in exercising data protection rights  
The Directive provides for a set of rights for individuals, such as the right to access, rectify, 
block and delete their own data, as well as the right to receive information for what purposes 
and by whom their data are processed. The Directive also provides judicial remedies as well 
as the right to receive compensation for damage suffered. These rights are, however, 
expressed in general terms and the way they can actually be exercised is not clearly specified.  
– Difficulties to access one’s own data 
Access to personal data is a significant matter77: as evidenced by a 2008 survey of data 
controllers, 46% of data controllers surveyed indicated that their company had received 
requests for access to personal data in the preceding year78. 
However, individuals can access their own data more easily in some Member States than in 
others. In some Member States, data controllers are allowed to demand a fee to access their 
data, while in others it is free of charge79. Some Member States impose a deadline on data 
controllers to respond to access requests, while others do not. The Commission has received 
several complaints from individuals that asked data controllers for access to the data stored 
about them and received no or unsatisfactory responses. Complaints to their national data 
protection authorities did not lead to effective remedies, as these authorities declared 
themselves not competent or incapable of following up in some cases. All these observations 
contribute to individuals' perception that their rights are not effectively guaranteed by the 
current implementation of the framework across the Member States. 
– Difficulties to have one's own data deleted – the “right to be forgotten” 
                                                 
77  Access to personal data is part of the fundamental right to data protection as enshrined in the charter of fundamental rights. 
78  EB 2008.  
79  EB 2011. 
 
EN 28   EN 
The right to request the deletion of data is provided by the Directive, but in practice it is 
difficult for an individual to enforce this right vis-à-vis the data controller. Recent reported 
cases about people seeking to have their data deleted from a social network are a telling 
example of the practical difficulty to exercise this right especially in the online environment80. 
While the Directive already requires that data is not kept in a form which permits 
identification of data subjects for any longer than necessary for the purposes for which the 
data were originally collected or for compatible purposes for which they are further 
processed, in practice this is often not implemented properly. For an individual, it is very 
difficult to assess the data preservation policies of a data controller. In any case, if the 
processing of personal data is based only on the consent of the data subjects, there is generally 
no justification for keeping this data after the data subjects have withdrawn their consent and 
requested deletion of the data. Faced with different interpretations and practices in different 
Member States, both individuals and data controller need more clarity on the rules on the 
deletion of data. 
– Difficulties to withdraw and transfer personal data from an application or 
service – “data portability” 
There is also no explicit right for the individual to extract his/her own personal data (e.g. 
his/her photos or a list of friends) from an application or service in a format that may be 
processed further, so that the individual may transfer data to another application or service. 
With increasing use of certain online service, the amount of personal data collected in this 
service becomes an obstacle for changing services, even if better, cheaper or more privacy 
friendly services become available. This could mean the loss of contact information, calendar 
history, interpersonal communications exchanges and other kinds of personally or socially 
relevant data which is very difficult to recreate or restore. Even where possible, re-entering 
the data manually into another service can be a major effort. This situation effectively creates 
a lock-in with the specific service for the user and makes it effectively very costly or even 
impossible to change provider and benefit from better services available on the market. 
Portability is a key factor for effective competition, as evidenced in other market sectors, e.g. 
number portability in the telecom sector. 
– Difficulties to access effective remedies 
As regards administrative and judicial remedies and compensation, individuals are in most 
cases not aware of the possibility to lodge a complaint to a DPA: 63% of respondents to a 
recent Eurobarometer have never heard of any public authority responsible for the protection 
of personal data81. 
Therefore, in many Member States judicial remedies, while available, are very rarely pursued 
in practice. This is also related to a general reluctance to bring an action to court against large 
global companies in particular, when costs for legal action are disproportionate compared to 
the potential compensation that could be obtained.  
Whereas the Directive provides the possibility that associations representing a data subject 
may lodge claims to the DPA, there is not a right to be represented by an association in a 
court case, which might otherwise give an incentive and limit the financial risk of going to 
court in relation to an infringement of data protection rules.

3.3.2. Who is affected and to what extent? 
The difficulties in exercising data protection rights potentially affect every individual in the 
EU, given the rapid growth of digital information on individuals as a result of evolving 
information and communication technologies. Processing of personal data is part of 
everybody's daily life: every transaction is likely to create a digital record, e.g. opening a bank 
account, shopping on line (on average, about 40% of individuals in the EU currently use the 
internet to purchase goods and services82), requesting a shop's loyalty card, buying a book or 
uploading photos on the internet.  
a) Individuals 
Individuals, including children, are potentially exposed to different types of harm. This 
includes reputational or even physical harm (caused e.g. by the publication of health-related 
data on a public blog without the concerned person's consent or harassment caused e.g. by 
unsolicited advertising) and also financial harm particularly by identity theft, the total cost of 
which at EU level is estimated at around €700 million per year83. In particular for young 
people, the disclosure of personal data can cause immense social and mental harm. The media 
have given much attention to several recent cases where sensitive personal information was 
published and led to bullying and harassment or serious humiliation so that the victim was 
driven into suicide. Personal data breaches are also becoming more common and more severe. 
A 2010 study84 in the UK indicates that, out of 622 UK-based IT and business managers, 
analysts, and executives from 15 industry sectors, 71% reported at least one incident of data 
breach in their respective organisations. The same study reports that while the average 
organisational cost of a data breach decreased by nearly 3% – from £1.73 million in the 2008 
annual study to £1.68 million in 2009 – the average cost per compromised personal data-set 
rose by £4 (7%), from £60 to £64 (approximately €7485). 
Based on information from 20 Member States, there were 54,640 complaints concerning 
(potentially) unlawful processing of personal data or breaches of data protection rights in the 
EU in 200986. Half of the total number of requests and complaints received by the 
Commission in 2010 in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms concern data protection87. 
Many individuals may have experienced detriment, but either resolved the issue with the data 
controller or did not pursue the complaint. Those that pursue a complaint are likely to have 
experienced significant harm. Over a third (39%) of all potential EU users of the internet may 
not be fully benefitting because of concerns over safety and data protection88. Individuals 
limit their use of new technologies, particularly the internet and online services, because of 
lack of trust in the digital environment and fears about possible misuse of their personal data. 
Those not benefitting from ICT because of fears over data protection lose out in terms of price 
benefits online and in time taken to access goods and services.

Privacy and the protection of personal data are fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They play a key role for the exercise of 
fundamental rights in a broader sense. Many of the fundamental freedoms can only be fully 
exercised if the individual is reassured that it is not subject of permanent surveillance and 
observation by authorities and other powerful organisations. Freedom of thought, freedom of 
expression, freedom of assembly and association, but also the freedom to conduct a business 
will not be exercised fully by all citizens in an environment where the individual feels that 
each of her or his moves, acts, expressions and transaction is subject to scrutiny by others 
trying to control him or her. Exercise of these freedoms is crucial to maintain all fundamental 
rights. 
In a free and democratic society, the individual must have reassurance that fundamental rights 
are respected. Measures to protect individuals with regard to the processing of personal data 
must be effective, credible and easily accessible for the individual. Information about risks to 
privacy must be made accessible and the conditions of the processing of personal data must 
be transparent and understandable. 
In today's digitised society, communication and interaction rely on digital media and 
communications channels. Web 2.0 tools, including social media, play an increasingly 
important role for social interaction and exchange. Not being able to use these media 
effectively restricts the exercise of fundamental rights in the social reality. Where the 
individual suspects that his or her interactions in this space are subject of surveillance, 
collection and analysis by authorities, service operators or others, it looses partly the 
possibility of exercising some fundamental rights. This chilling effect can already be caused 
by the perception of surveillance, which may or may not exist. The lack of transparency of 
processing and of accessible means to effectively enforce data protection rules is therefore 
directly affecting individuals' fundamental rights. 
The same effect is also true with regard to the economic aspects of citizens' life. Be it 
consumers who are subject to profiling and classification, or employees or job candidates 
subject to extensive research and analysis of their online activities, the economic possibilities 
of individuals are reduced towards the organisations having access to extensive data 
collections about them. The individual's negotiation position is severely affected by the 
imbalance of information and the possibility of the other side to use detailed knowledge of the 
situation and needs, e.g. when offering a loan or an employment contract with less 
advantageous conditions for the consumer or employee. 
Lack of transparency of data processing, lack of credible enforcement and the absence of 
effective remedies and sanctions for violations of the principles contribute to creating a 
climate in which the individuals do not rely on exercising their fundamental freedoms and 
economic rights fully, even when some concerns regarding data collection and surveillance 
may be exaggerated over the reality. Doubts about the actual degree of protection have a 
chilling effect on democracy and also on the economic activity in the market.  
b) Economic operators  
Many economic activities are linked to the processing of personal data. The current 
inconsistent application of EU laws impacts the take-up of online and audiovisual media 
services. Individuals limit their use of new technologies because of a lack of trust in the 
digital environment and fears about possible misuse of their data. This creates costs for 
economic operators and public authorities and slows down innovation. Strong growth of the 
internet economy, widespread use of new mobile devices and the expansion of e-commerce 
and other web-based services could bring tremendous economic benefits. 
 
EN 31   EN 
c) Public authorities  
Public authorities have undertaken considerable investments in making public services 
accessible online. This dematerialisation can create considerable benefits in terms of 
efficiency, quality of services and reduction of resources required for the provision of 
services. When citizens can enter their requests for certain public service directly into online 
systems, they enjoy a better service then when they would have to go to the authority 
physically or to communicate in writing, while the authority at the same time saves resources 
for servicing physical visitors or processing paper mail and for entering data into their 
systems. 
The potential benefits require citizens' willingness to make use of online offerings. Lack of 
confidence and trust in the services, fear or potential misuse of data collected will make many 
potential users refrain from using these services. With growing concern about privacy in the 
online world, this section of the population may grow further. This development reduces the 
value of the investments in public online services and their positive effects for the public 
budget, when the more traditional and more expensive ways of offering public services have 
to be maintained. 
3.4. PROBLEM 3 – Gaps and inconsistencies in the protection of personal data in the 
field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters  
3.4.1. Description of the problem89  
The scope of the Directive, based on an internal market legal basis, specifically excluded 
police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Framework Decision adopted in 2008 
to regulate data processing in the area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in 
criminal matters reflects the specificities of the pre-Lisbon "pillar" structure of the EU90 and is 
characterised by a limited scope and various other gaps, often leading to legal uncertainty 
for individuals and law enforcement authorities, as well as to practical difficulties of 
implementation. Moreover, while the Framework Decision contains general data protection 
principles (e.g., on lawfulness of data processing, right to access, rectify and delete one's own 
personal data), it provides at the same time for wide possibilities of derogating to them at 
national level, thereby not harmonising them. This does not only risk emptying such 
principles of their very purpose – and thus negatively affecting the fundamental right of 
individuals to the protection of their personal data in this area - but also hinders the smooth 
exchange of personal data between relevant national authorities. This situation is aggravated 
by the uncertain relation between the Framework Decision and existing "former third pillar" 
instruments with specific data protection rules, which adds to the complexity of the legal 
framework at EU level and increases the legal uncertainty for both individuals and law 
enforcement authorities.   
 a) Limited scope of application of the Framework Decision 
The Framework Decision is limited in scope in that it does not cover data processing by 
police and judicial authorities at domestic (purely national) level, since its scope is limited to 
cross-border processing activities (i.e. personal data that "are or have been transmitted or 
made available" between Member States or between a Member State and Union authorities or 
                                                 
89  See Annex 3 for further details. 
90  This also entails no powers for the Commission to launch infringement procedures against Member States and limited powers for 
the ECJ for a transitional period of 5 years from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (i.e. until 1st December 2014). See 
Article 10 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions annexed to the treaties. 
 
EN 32   EN 
bodies91).  This is problematic both in legal and in practical terms. Legally, the newly 
established Article 16 TFEU covers all areas "which fall under the scope of Union law" - thus 
including police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters92. Hence, both 
'purely domestic' and 'cross-border' activities are covered. Given that the Framework Decision 
only covers cross-border processing activities of police and judicial authorities in criminal 
matters, the legislator has now the duty to extend its scope in order to fill this gap, which 
causes several problems93. 
First of all, as confirmed by several Member States' experts during the workshop organised on 
2 February 2011 on the implementation of the Framework Decision and in the replies to the 
Commission's questionnaire related to the implementation of the Framework Decision94, 
personal data which have been gathered in a purely domestic context can hardly be factually 
distinguished from data that have been subject to cross-border transmission. Plus, a priori, 
any purely domestically processed data may be subject to cross-border transmission. This 
somehow "artificial" distinction thus complicates the actual implementation and application 
of the Framework Decision: law enforcement authorities are burdened by unmanageable 
distinctions between domestic data and data transmitted or available for transmission. 
Criminal files are in quite a number of cases composed of data originating from different 
authorities. The consequence of the limited scope is that parts of such files — the parts 
containing data originating from authorities in other Member States — are protected under the 
Framework Decision whereas other parts are not protected, or at least not under the same 
regime. In addition, the legal certainty for individuals can be harmed since data originating 
from third countries, but not exchanged between Member States are not covered by the 
Framework Decision. The processing of those data entails specific risks to the data subject 
should there be, for instance, no legal obligation in a Member State to examine the accuracy 
of those data.  
Secondly, good co-operation between Member States requires there to be mutual trust  
between  Member States, as a condition for a successful exchange of information. If common 
standards are applied to the processing of data this will facilitate cooperation and mutual 
exchange of information between Member States' law enforcement authorities. 
 
Finally, this distinction exists neither in the Directive nor in the relevant Council of Europe 
instruments95. 
 
b) Low level of harmonisation of the Framework Decision 
The Framework Decision provides for a very minimum level of harmonisation and leaves a 
very large room for manoeuvre to Member States in terms of its implementation into national 
law, for example in relation to the right of access of individuals to personal data related to 
them (Article 17) or to the exceptions to the purpose limitation principle (Articles 3 and 11). 
Provisions on information to be given to data subjects are very general (Article 16) and 
                                                 
91  Including information systems established on the basis of Title VI of the previous Treaty (TEU). 
92 Specific rules for processing by Member States in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy shall be laid down by a 
Council Decision based on Article 39 TEU.  
93    Article 16 states that "The European Parliament and the Council […] shall lay down the rules relating to the protection of 
individuals with regard to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data […]" (emphasis added). 
94  See the Implementation Report of the Framework decision (COM…) 
95  Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (CETS No.: 108), 
(‘Convention 108’) and its Additional Protocol (ETS No.: 181), as well as  Recommendation No R (87) 15 of the Committee of 
Ministers to Member States regulating the use of personal data in the police sector. 
 
EN 33   EN 
basically refer to national laws, and therefore implemented variably. Moreover, the 
Framework Decisions allows national laws to impose higher safeguards than those established 
in there for any issue covered (Article 1(2)). In certain cases, specific national processing 
restrictions in place in one Member State have to be met by the other Member States (Article 
12). Therefore, exchanges of information still remain subject to very different national ‘rules 
of origin’ and varying standards that affect efficiency in law enforcement cooperation. As a 
consequence, police authorities may have to apply heterogeneous legal requirements to 
processing systems containing data originating from different Member States depending on 
various factors, such as whether personal data have been collected domestically or not, 
whether each of the transmitting bodies has given its consent for the envisaged purpose, 
whether further processing restrictions requested by each of the transmitting bodies exist etc.   
Also rules on international transfers (Article 13) leave a large room of discretion to Member 
States in assessing the "adequacy" of a third country for the purposes of transferring personal 
data to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or the execution of criminal 
penalties. This creates legal uncertainty and affects practical implementation, as pointed our 
by some Member States in their reply to the questionnaire on the Implementation of the 
Framework Decision, calling for more uniform rules in this area96. The absence of a 
sufficiently harmonised system for the exchange of personal data with third countries also 
harms the trust between the authorities of the Member States, since an authority might be less 
willing to share information with an authority in another Member State if this Member State 
could also share this information with authorities of third countries in the absence of clear 
safeguards. It also enables "forum shopping" by authorities of third countries: those 
authorities could ask for information in the Member State with is considered to have the 
lowest legal  requirements for transfers. 
 
Additionally, the Framework Decision does not contain any mechanism – no implementing 
powers for the Commission, no advisory group similar to the "Article 29" Working Party - 
fostering a common approach in its implementation or supporting common interpretation of 
its provisions. The Commission has currently no infringement powers in cases of non- or 
incorrect transposition of the Framework Decision, and the Court of Justice has limited 
powers as well for a transitional 5-year period from the entry into force of the Lisbon 
Treaty97.  
 
c) Additional gaps and shortcomings of the Framework Decision  
The Framework Decision also fails to address issues that are particularly important in the 
framework of data processing by police cooperation and other law enforcement authorities.    
First of all, there are no specific provisions in the Framework Decision regulating the 
processing of genetic data for the purposes of a criminal investigation or a judicial procedure. 
As pointed out very clearly by the European Court of Human Rights98, this is an area were 
clear rules are essential to regulate the scope and application of measures by law enforcement 
authorities. The Court ruled that protection afforded by Article 8 of the European Convention 
                                                 
96  See the Annex to the Implementation Report of the Framework decision (COM…), Table 6. 
97  See footnote 91. 
98  S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 4 December 2008, applications nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, which showed 
the importance of adequately protecting such data particularly in relation to use by police authorities. The Court ruled, in 
particular, that as for the storing and use of this personal information, it was essential to have clear, detailed rules governing the 
scope and application of measures, as well as minimum safeguards.   
 
EN 34   EN 
on Human Rights would otherwise be unacceptably weakened by the use of modern scientific 
techniques (such as DNA testing) in the criminal justice system without a careful balancing 
between the potential benefits of the extensive use of such techniques against important 
private-life interests. 
Other relevant issues not covered by the Framework Decision, which are included in some 
other "former third pillar" instruments as well as in Recommendation No R (87) 15 of the 
Committee of Ministers to Member States regulating the use of personal data in the police 
sector, are the following: 
– The need to distinguish personal data according to their degree of accuracy and 
reliability, or whether they are based on facts or on opinions or personal assessments. 
The lack of such a requirement could actually undermine the data being exchanged 
between police authorities as they will not be able to ascertain whether the data can be 
construed as ‘evidence’, ‘fact’, ‘hard intelligence’ or ‘soft intelligence’. This could have 
the consequence of hampering security operations and of making it more difficult for 
courts to secure convictions; 
 
– The need to distinguish between different categories of data subjects (criminals, 
suspects, victims, witnesses, etc.), and to provide in particular for specific guarantees 
for data relating to non-suspects. Again, these distinctions are on the one hand 
necessary for the protection of the concerned individuals and on the other hand for the 
ability of the recipient law enforcement authorities to be able to make full use of the 
data they receive.  
d) Unclear relation between the Framework Decision and other "former third pillar" 
instruments  
In addition to the above problems linked to the limited scope and other gaps of the 
Framework Decision, the relation between its provisions and specific data protection rules 
contained in other "former third pillar" legal acts99 – adopted prior to the Framework Decision 
- is not entirely clear. In principle, the Framework Decision leaves unaffected most of the acts 
previously adopted containing specific data protection provisions, in particular where such 
provisions constitute "a complete and coherent set of rules"100. In other cases, however, the 
Framework Decision is only partially applicable, i.e. it does not apply where the provisions of 
these (former third pillar) acts impose conditions upon the receiving Member States that are 
"more restrictive" than those in the Framework Decision101. These rules setting the relation 
between the Framework Decision and data protection provisions contained in other acts in the 
area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters are unclear and leave a large room 
for interpretation on a case-by-case basis as to which rules shall apply to a concrete situation. 
The result is a fragmented environment creating legal uncertainty for both the concerned 
individuals and law enforcement authorities. As a consequence, law enforcement agencies 
may be reluctant to share information for enforcement purposes due to concerns about the 
legal consequences102. This negatively affects the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation in 
this area. 
                                                 
99  See Annex 3 for the list of such acts. 
100  See Article 28 and recital 39. Some of these instruments are specifically mentioned (e.g. the acts regulating the functioning of 
Europol, Eurojust, the Schengen Information System and the Customs Information System) but the list is not exhaustive.; 
101  See recital 40. 
102  This is confirmed by a (non-public) study carried out by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development ("Study on 
the status of information exchange amongst law enforcement authorities in the context of existing EU instruments", September 
 
EN 35   EN 
Example 5 – Difficulties for police authorities created by a variable and complex legal environment 
 
A police authority in one Member State (country A) is dealing with an investigation related to cross-border 
trafficking of human beings. The nature of the case implies that information, including personal data of suspects, 
is required from two other Member States (country B and country C).  
When processing the data related to the above investigation, the police authorities in country A have to apply 
different data protection rules for different aspects of the file related to the investigation, depending on whether 
the data come from their own Member State or have been received from country B or C. This means that, for 
example, different rules may apply to the further transmission of data related to the investigation – which may 
not be easily separated/distinguished depending on their origin - to other non-police authorities (i.e., immigration 
or asylum authorities) or in relation to the information that can be provided to the individuals concerned. 
3.4.2. Who is affected and to what extent? 
The complex and fragmented legal environment in the area of police cooperation and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters is highly problematic as it creates uncertainties about the rules 
applicable and hence affects individuals, public authorities and private data controllers, in the 
following way:  
– Individuals are unlikely to know which rules apply to the processing of personal data 
by the police and other law enforcement authorities and thus what their rights are in this 
context. They also enjoy different rights depending on which Member State or public 
authority is processing their data.  
 
– The differences in Member States' data protection standards in this area, as well as the 
uncertainties about the rules to be applied to a specific situation, affect the smooth 
cooperation between Member States' police and judicial authorities. The fact that 
different, sometimes conflicting rules, may apply to personal data related to a same 
investigation – depending on the origin of the data and/or on which specific instruments 
apply - adds a layer of complexity to the work of police and other competent authorities 
in Member States, particularly in the case of cross-border matters. 
 
– Private companies operating in different Member States are affected by the absence of 
common and uniform rules at EU level on issues such as further processing by law 
enforcement authorities of data held by them. 
3.5. The drivers behind the identified problems  
The main drivers behind the three problems are the shortcomings of the existing legal 
framework and of the current governance system in the area of data protection.  
As regards the Directive, the analysis of the problems showed that, while most of its key 
principles remain sound, several of its provisions are not sufficiently clear, are sometimes 
difficult to apply to new situations and developments and often leave an excessively large 
margin of manoeuvre to Member States in their national implementation. This leads to 
important variations and divergences across the EU. Enforcement of the Directive is not 
always satisfactory and, above all, is inconsistent across Member States. 
                                                                                                                                                         
2010). The study finds that one of the main legal problems in cross-border information exchange derive from the differences in 
national legislation in member States, in particular differences in privacy and data protection always (or the different definitions 
of what constitutes a crime). 
 
EN 36   EN 
This has precluded the desired level of harmonisation within the internal market, created legal 
uncertainty and unnecessary costs for business (Problem 1) and made it difficult for 
individuals to exercise their rights effectively (Problem 2). 
Protection of personal data in the area of police co-operation and judicial co-operation in 
criminal matters is characterised by a lower level of harmonisation (limited scope, wide 
derogations, insufficient safeguards) and a fragmented landscape, leading to legal uncertainty 
(Problem 3). Enforcement is even more problematic in this area given the peculiarities of the 
"former third pillar acquis" in terms of (limited) powers of the Commission and of the ECJ.   
Globalisation and technological developments have contributed to and exacerbated all three 
problems, by greatly facilitating and encouraging the exchanges and flows of personal data 
worldwide in all areas and sectors, including law enforcement, with the development of new 
applications and services and the availability of increasingly sophisticated tools.   
3.6. Baseline scenario: How would the problem evolve?  
Globalisation and technological developments, which are the common drivers of the problems 
are expected to pose ever-increasing challenges to the fundamental right to data protection. 
The extent and the seriousness of existing problems are therefore also expected to increase. 
Without further regulatory intervention, it is anticipated that under the baseline scenario the 
problems in the current situation would evolve as follows: 
3.6.1. Fragmentation, legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement  
Member States are likely to continue to implement and enforce the Directive in a diverging 
way. Data protection issues with a cross-border dimension are likely to remain without a 
consistent response. 
The numbers of businesses operating in more than one Member State and of public authorities 
exchanging data with other Member States’ authorities are expected to continue to rise (due in 
particular to further EU integration and globalisation, involving for instance e-government 
applications and the increasing ease of exchanging personal data103). Given that the largest 
part of the administrative and compliance costs originates from cross-border processing, the 
costs for companies (particularly large companies) and public authorities are likely to increase 
further.  
The total administrative burden imposed by the Directive in the baseline scenario is 
estimated to amount to about €5,3 billion per annum. The costs of legal fragmentation in the 
baseline scenario (expressed solely in terms of administrative burden) for economic operators 
processing personal data in more than one Member State, are estimated to amount to 
approximately €2.9 billion per annum (see Annex 9 for details). 
As regards enforcement, experience has shown that the progressive increase in cross-border 
transfers and of data controllers operating across several Member States did not lead, by itself, 
to increased cooperation between Data Protection Authorities. The legal uncertainty caused 
by inconsistent – and sometimes contradictory – decisions taken by DPAs will therefore 
increase, as will related costs. As a result, the credibility of the EU data protection framework 
will gradually decline. 
                                                 
103  This is one of the key targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe. For more see Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2011, available at 
http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/scoreboard/docs/scoreboard.pdf, p.16-17. 
 
EN 37   EN 
3.6.2. Difficulties for individuals in exercising their data protection rights effectively   
There is a strong likelihood that the current difficulties in maintaining control over one's own 
data and in effectively exercising data protection rights will increase, given the large and 
growing volume of personal data collected and the ease with which it can be processed and 
communicated thanks to new technologies.  
Individuals are likely to encounter increasing problems with the protection of their personal 
data, or refrain from fully using the internet as a medium for communication and commercial 
transactions. The 75% of individuals currently not feeling in complete control of their 
personal data on social networking sites (and 80% when shopping online) is not likely to 
decrease without regulatory intervention which can support the confidence of individuals. 
Such a development could counteract the key performance target of the Digital Agenda for 
Europe for 50 % of the population to buy online by 2015.104  
Individuals are also likely to face increasing difficulties in knowing what their data protection 
rights are when their data are processed by companies or public authorities involved in cross 
border data processing, in particular with the development of cloud computing. They would 
increasingly be unable to foresee the scope of their data protection rights in order to adapt 
their behaviour. 
3.6.3. Inconsistencies and gaps in the protection of personal data in the field of police 
and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and inconsistency of the rules 
The Commission and the Court of Justice will eventually become competent as regards the 
implementation and the application of the Framework Decision after the expiry of the five-
year transition period provided by the Lisbon Treaty. Thus, the "lisbonisation" of the 
Framework Decision will be a matter of fact as of 1st December 2014 even in the absence of 
an intervention from the legislator.   
However, the problems and difficulties linked to the limited scope and other gaps of the 
Framework Decision will become more acute in the current context of growing intra-EU and 
international cooperation and data exchange as showed by the increasing number of 
exchanges of personal data for these purposes, at  EU or Member State's level. Also the 
current fragmentation will be maintained.  
3.7. SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  
3.7.1. Subsidiarity 
The need for EU level legislation on the protection of personal data and the free flow of such 
data within the Union was already recognized by the European legislator with the adoption of 
the Directive. As explained in the previous sections, while the Directive has indeed 
contributed to addressing the problems observed at the time, such problems have become 
more important and widespread due to the recent technical and economic developments. 
Therefore, the need for an EU level instrument further harmonising the protection of personal 
data is even more urgent today than when the Directive was adopted. 
In light of the problems outlined above, the analysis of subsidiarity indicates the necessity of 
EU-level action on the following grounds:  
                                                 
104  Ibidem, p.12. 
 
EN 38   EN 
– The right to the protection of personal data is enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights. Article 16 TFEU is the legal basis for the adoption of rules relating 
to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Union 
institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and by the Member States when carrying out 
activities which fall within the scope of Union law, and the rules relating to the free 
movement of such data;  
 
– Personal data can be transferred across national boundaries, both EU-internal borders and 
to third countries, at rapidly increasing rates. In addition, there are practical challenges to 
enforcing data protection legislation and a need for cooperation between Member States 
and their authorities, which need to be organised at EU level to ensure the necessary 
coherence and level of protection within the Union. The EU is also best placed to ensure 
effectively and consistently the same level of protection for individuals when their 
personal data are transferred to third countries; 
  
– Member States cannot alone reduce the problems in the current situation. This is 
particularly the case for those problems that arise from the fragmentation in national 
legislations implementing the EU data protection regulatory framework. Thus, there is a 
strong rationale for the legal framework for data protection being at the EU level. There is 
a particular need to establish a harmonised and coherent framework allowing for a smooth 
transfer of personal data across borders within the EU while ensuring effective protection 
to all individuals across the EU; 
  
– Whilst it would be possible for Member States to enact policies which ensure that this 
right is not breached, this would not be achieved in a uniform way in the absence of 
common EU rules and would create restrictions on cross-border flows of personal data to 
other Member States that do not meet the same data protection standards; 
  
– The EU legislative actions proposed are likely to be more effective than similar actions at 
the level of Member States because of the nature and scale of the problems, which are not 
confined to the level of one or several Member States.  
3.7.2. Proportionality 
One of the aims of the reform is to reduce the current legal fragmentation and all the problems 
linked to that (see Section 3.2.1 above), in particular by further harmonising Member States' 
substantive laws and by setting up governance mechanisms to make enforcement more 
effective and more consistent across the EU.   
The envisaged actions are proportionate as they are within the scope of the Union 
competences as defined by the Treaties and are necessary to ensure uniformity of application 
of EU legislation, ensuring effective and equal protection of individuals' fundamental rights. 
Action at EU level is essential to continue ensuring credibility and a high level of data 
protection in a globalized world, while maintaining the free flow of data. The proper 
functioning of the internal market requires that the provisions ensure a level playing field for 
economic operators. 
The current initiative builds on the current Directive and intends to cover the existing gaps by 
making the implementation of existing principles by Member States more effective and their 
application more cost efficient. To this end, the reform intends to strengthen the coordination 
powers and reinforce the role of the advisory body composed of the Data protection 
 
EN 39   EN 
authorities of the EU, currently the Article 29 Working Party. The powers of the existing data 
protection authorities should also be more harmonised to ensure a better and more consistent 
enforcement. The Commission also intends to facilitate certain procedures and instruments 
relating to the relation between the Union and third countries, such as Binding Corporate 
Rules, which are an existing co-regulation mechanism, where no comprehensive mutual 
recognition system at EU level was ensured. 
Where possible, the reform leaves space to actors to implement appropriate measures to 
achieve the purpose of the instruments, e.g. by strengthening accountability and responsibility 
of data controllers and processors for assessing and mitigating data protection risks and by 
cutting unnecessary administrative burden, with the objective of reinforcing the 
proportionality of the data protection framework.  
Compared to the existing legislation, the Commission aim is to propose a stronger and more 
prescriptive approach in the area of data protection. This approach is justified by the 
observations of the practical operation of the current system and the problems described in the 
present impact assessment. Where the current Directive deliberately and explicitly leaves 
margin to Member States for interpretation, this has led to widely diverging interpretation and 
practices. This is also true to a large extent for those cases where the Directive fails to provide 
for clear rules or where it is silent. In an environment where processing of personal data was 
predominantly at national level and transfer across borders was still limited, such differences 
could be tolerated, even though with some limiting effects. As in the meantime the internal 
market has become more important and effective, in particular due to the increased provision 
of services online, for which cross border operation is possible without any extra efforts or 
costs, the divergences have become such an important obstacle that stronger measures at EU 
level are required. The Commission's proposal observes the need to balance by providing for 
stronger measures only in those areas of Union competence where the protection of 
fundamental rights and the Single Market require stronger harmonisation and by leaving 
margin to Member States in all areas where culture, tradition or the national constitutional 
system require this, e.g. : 
- the area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. While general 
data protection rules will as a matter of principle be applicable to this area as well, some 
flexibility will be left to Member States in defining the limitations and exceptions; 
- the relation between data protection and freedom of expression, which is very much linked 
to cultural and social traditions in Member States. 
3.8. Relation with fundamental rights 
The right to protection of personal data is established by Article 8 of the Charter and Article 
16 TFEU, based on Directive 95/46/EC as well in Article 8 of the ECHR and in the Council 
of Europe 108 Convention. As clarified by the ECJ (judgment of 9.11.2010 in cases C-92/09 
and 93/09, Schecke), the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but 
must be considered in relation to its function in society105.  
Data protection is closely linked to respect for private and family life protected by Article 7 
of the Charter. This is reflected by Article 1(1) of Directive 95/46/EC which provides that,  
                                                 
105  In line with Article 52(1) of the Charter, limitations may be imposed on the exercise of the right to data protection as long as the 
limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of the right and freedoms and, subject to the principle of proportionality, 
are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights 
and freedoms of others. 
 
EN 40   EN 
Member States shall protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in 
particular their right to privacy with respect of the processing of personal data. Other 
potentially affected fundamental rights are the following:  
– Freedom of expression (Article 11 of the Charter);   
– Freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and 
practices (Article 16); 
– The right to property and in particular the protection of intellectual property(Article 
17(2);  
– The prohibition of any discrimination amongst others on grounds such as race, ethnic 
origin, genetic features, religion or belief, political opinion or any other opinion, disability 
or sexual orientation (Article 21); 
– The rights of the child (Article 24); 
– A high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all the 
Union's policies and activities (Article 35 of the Charter); 
– The right to an effective remedy before a tribunal (Article 47 of the Charter). 
The impact of the measures proposed in the framework of the data protection reform on these 
rights is examined in Section 6 and in Annex 7. 
4. POLICY OBJECTIVES 
The current reform aims at, first of all, completing the achievement of the original 
objectives, taking account of new developments and challenges arising today, i.e.: 
1. Enhancing the internal market dimension of data protection; 
2. Increasing the effectiveness of the fundamental right to data protection . 
In addition, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty - and in particular the introduction of a 
new legal basis (Article 16 TFEU) - offers the opportunity to achieve a new objective, i.e.: 
3. Establishing a comprehensive EU data protection framework and enhancing the 
coherence and consistency of EU data protection rules, including in the field of 
police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters .  
In order to enhance the internal market dimension of data protection (objective 1), the 
Commission strives to achieve the specific objectives of:  
• Harmonising and clarifying EU data protection rules and procedures to 
create a level playing field.  
Diverging national interpretations of concepts, principles and procedures under 
EU data protection rules shall be prevented. Key elements of the legal 
provisions shall be clearly and completely defined at EU level, leaving margin 
for interpretation to Member States only where this is necessary in order to 
properly respect national legal, social, cultural and administrative traditions 
and systems to the extent that these differences do not undermine the 
functioning of the internal market. This shall also ensure that data controllers 
enjoy legal certainty on the obligations they are subject to, on the basis of EU 
wide provisions. At the same time, flexibility and adaptability of the 
framework to technical, economical and societal development must be ensured 
at EU level. Rather than leaving a wide margin of interpretation to Member 
States, additional clarification and precision of the rules and procedures shall 
 
EN 41   EN 
be added to the framework at EU level through a faster and more lightweight 
procedure than a full legislative procedure. The Union's position in the global 
economy shall be strengthened by simplifying and clarifying the conditions for 
the transfer of personal data to third countries.  
• Ensuring consistent enforcement of data protection rules.  
Further to increasing harmonisation of the legal provisions as such, their 
practical application and enforcement should also be more consistent. To this 
effect, data controllers shall have a single authority as the unique contact point 
for supervision and enforcement cases throughout the entire EU, which shall 
act on the basis of appropriate and effective coordination ensuring consistency 
of the principles applied by all authorities. Authorities' powers shall be 
equivalent and adequate throughout the Union and they shall be equipped with 
adequate resources. 
• Cutting red tape. 
While harmonisation and consistent enforcement will already contribute to 
drastically reducing duplication of administrative burden needed for 
compliance with diverging procedures and interpretations, the reform shall 
ensure that only such information and notification obligations are maintained 
that have a positive effect on the protection of personal. Procedures for data 
transfers to third countries shall be clear, simple and effective in ensuring data 
protection. 
In order to increase the effectiveness of data protection rights (objective 2), the Commission 
strives to achieve the specific objectives of  
• Ensuring that individuals are in control of their personal data and trust 
the digital environment, 
Individuals must enjoy effective transparency about the conditions of the 
processing so that they can make a meaningful decision whether or not to agree 
to it. The individual should be aware when they are deemed to giving their 
consent to data processing. They should also be reassured that they will be 
informed about any breaches of the security of their personal data. The 
execution of individuals' rights should be easy and their extent should be clear, 
e.g. regarding access to their own data and its withdrawal and transfer form one 
data controller to another or its deletion, as well as the data controller's 
obligation to minimise the processing of personal data. Another element for the 
creation of trust and confidence is clarity about available remedies in cases of 
breaches and appropriate sanctions. In cases concerning many persons, it 
should not be up to each data subject to pursue legal redress individually, but it 
should be possible to handle cases through associations, reducing effort for 
data controllers, individuals and the supervisory and judicial system. 
• Ensuring that individuals remain protected including when their data are 
processed abroad 
Individuals should have confidence that they enjoy data protection rights 
whenever they buy goods or use services (including information society 
services) that are offered to them from outside the EU  or when their behaviour 
 
EN 42   EN 
is monitored (for example, when people are tracked on the internet with data 
processing techniques applying a 'profile' to them, particularly to take decisions 
concerning them based on their preferences, behaviour or attitudes).  
• Reinforcing the accountability of those processing personal data. 
Individuals can gain more confidence in data protection when they can rely on 
data controllers' interest in actually ensuring appropriate safeguards rather than 
only being formally compliant with the letter of the law. Data controllers 
should be incentivised to take this approach by increasing their responsibility 
and accountability for the measures they take. By this, they should be 
encouraged to apply the principle of privacy by design or to perform privacy 
impact assessments. 
In order to increase the coherence of the data protection framework across all areas of Union 
competence (objective 3), the Commission strives to achieve the specific objectives of 
• Ensuring that individuals' data protection rights are fully guaranteed in 
this area and  
• Enhancing trust and facilitating police co-operation and judicial co-
operation in criminal matters. 
It should be clear that the principles of data protection apply also to this area, 
including also to domestic processing in the police and judicial area. This will 
include seamless integration into the competences of the Court of Justice of the 
EU and of the Commission, as well as an increased role for data protection 
authorities and their coordination body (currently the Article 29 Working 
Party). 
This will enhance the coherence and consistency of the EU data protection 
framework, in particular by revising the current rules on data protection in the 
area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It will 
also contribute to the fulfilment of the original objectives of the Framework 
Decision, i.e. the need to ensure  a high level of protection to individuals, on 
the one hand, and to enhance mutual trust and facilitate the exchange of 
information between police and judicial authorities, on the other hand.  
Table 1 below sets out the specific and operational objectives.

Compliance with horizontal EU policies 
The above objectives are in compliance with and complement the horizontal policies of the 
EU. In particular: 
– the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Single Market Act106, as they help deepening the 
internal market by streamlining rules and further harmonising them where needed, thereby 
boosting EU business competitiveness; 
– the Digital Agenda for Europe107, since they contribute to the development of a digital 
single market and aim to increase individuals' digital confidence; 
– the Action Plan for Implementing the Stockholm Programme, as they "strengthen the EU’s 
stance in protecting the personal data of the individual in the context of all EU policies" 
and in the context of international relations; 
– the general EU Better Regulation policy108, as they aim at simplifying the regulatory 
environment, streamlining existing obligations and procedures and reducing 
administrative burden (see also § 7.4 below); 
– the Small Business Act for Europe109, as it provides a comprehensive SME policy 
framework, promotes entrepreneurship and anchors the "Think Small First" principle in 
law and policy making to strengthen SMEs' competiveness.  
5. POLICY OPTIONS 
A number of possible measures have been identified to address each of the three problems 
and to achieve the objectives defined in Section 4. Measures differ in the extent of EU 
intervention, and in particular in the strength of the regulatory approach, ranging from 
interpretative guidance and codification of best practices, to further and detailed 
harmonisation of rules and centralised enforcement. By grouping measures according to their 
strength, three options have been identified, each of which represents a comprehensive 
approach aiming at achieving the identified policy objectives. 
• Option 1 would mostly rely on clarifying the interpretation and application of the 
existing rules via 'soft law' and provide for a limited legislative intervention aimed at 
codifying existing best practices and clarifying some specific concepts. Due to the 
nature of problem 3, i.e. improving data protection rules in the area of police and 
justice, this approach would not be suitable to address it; therefore, option 1 does not 
contain measures related to this problem. 
• Most of the measures composing option 2 require legislative amendments, although 
the non-regulatory measures under policy option 1 could be combined with or added 
to the measures under this option. This concerns in particular actions on awareness 
raising and promotion of PETs. This option contains measures addressing all three 
problem areas. 
                                                 
106  COM(2011)206 final. 
107  COM(2010)245 final. 
108  See http://ec.europa.eu/governance/better_regulation/index_en.htm. 
109  COM(2008)394 final; cf. on the review of the "Small Business Act" COM(2011)78 final. 
 
EN 45   EN 
• Policy option 3 would also be based on an essentially legislative approach and 
include most of the measures considered under option 2. It would, however, go 
farther and provide for more detailed and prescriptive rules, also regulating and 
harmonising specific sectors. It would also apply a 'centralised' approach in relation 
to enforcement by establishing a European agency. As regards the former "third 
pillar", this option would also be the most far-reaching as it would foresee the 
amendment of all "third pillar" instruments in order to align them entirely with the 
new data protection rules. This option contains measures addressing all three 
problem areas. 
The options are described in more detail below. For the status quo option see the description 
of the baseline scenario under Section 3.6. 
5.1. Options to address Problem 1: Barriers for business and public authorities due 
to fragmentation, legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement 
5.1.1. Addressing fragmentation and legal uncertainty 
Option 1: Interpretation, technical support tools and encouragement of self-regulation. 
Under this option, the Commission would make extensive use of soft policy instruments and 
provide technological support to Member State authorities in order to improve the regulatory 
environment in the internal market, and propose only very limited legislative amendments 
targeted at specific issues that cannot be addressed effectively in any other way.  
This option would include in particular: 
• Creating a single EU-wide IT system (central platform) for notifying processing, based 
on a common format and procedures agreed by national DPAs,  would be set up. Data 
controllers would submit only one form electronically and mark the countries they need to 
notify (as proposed by the WP29 in its Advice paper on the matter). Requirements, 
exceptions and derogations (currently allowed for by the Directive) would however not be 
harmonised, which means that further information would have to be provided if required 
by national law(s). 
• Increased use of interpretative Communications by the Commission to provide more 
detailed guidance to Member States, public authorities and businesses on the application 
of Union law, and on the interpretation of certain concepts defined in the Directive to 
favour a more uniform interpretation of the current rule. These would in primis cover 
issues and notions whose diverging interpretation has led to quite different 
implementation and practices by Member States (e.g. definition of personal data, 
provisions on applicable law). 
• The lack of harmonisation would further be addressed by the encouragement of EU-wide 
self-regulation initiatives building on the existing data protection acquis ("co-
regulation"), e.g. on on-line advertising, medical research, e-health, network and 
information security. The Commission would support this process by providing support 
and advice, building on its own experience with these types of instruments with the aim of 
ensuring that the critical success factors (e.g. participation of all relevant stakeholder 
groups, transparency of the process, feedback and measurement, monitoring and 
enforcement)110 are properly taken into account. Use of the existing mechanisms for 
                                                 
110  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/self_regulation/ 
 
EN 46   EN 
formal recognition by national supervisory authorities and the Article 29 Working Party 
would be encouraged. 
• Limited legislative amendments to clarify the key criteria for adequacy of data 
protection in third countries, and to create an explicit legal basis for Binding Corporate 
Rules (BCRs), in order to facilitate secure international transfers of personal data.  
Option 2: Legislative amendments addressing gaps in current harmonisation that 
cause harmful fragmentation 
Under this option, the Commission would present legislative proposals aimed at solving 
specific problems caused by divergent approaches in Member States. These legislative 
proposals would concern in particular: 
• Simplified basic registration system: this would replace the current system of 
notifications by data controllers to DPAs with a simpler system of basic registration 
with DPAs (i.e. this registration would include the identity of the data controller, the 
contact details, an indication of the nature of the business; and an indication of the 
processing, and/or personal data held). 
• Ensure that data controllers are always subject to one single law. Two sub-options 
are possible: 
a) If the new instrument is a Directive, - the provisions on applicable law would be 
clarified in the following way: 
- for data controllers based in the EU, the sole criterion determining the applicable 
law would be the main establishment of the data controller, defined as the place of 
its establishment in the EU where the main decisions as to the purposes, conditions 
and means of the processing of personal data are taken and as the place where the 
main processing activities take place when no decision are taken in the EU; 
- For data controllers based outside the EU, the offering of goods and services 
(including information society services) to individuals in the EU, or the monitoring 
of EU individuals would become the main criteria to determine the applicable law.  
b) If the new instrument is a Regulation, the latter would be the law applicable 
throughout the EU. The Regulation would also be applicable to data controllers 
outside the EU if they offer goods and services (including information society 
services) to data subjects in the EU or monitor their behaviour. 
• Ensure that one single DPA – the one of the Member State of main establishment - is 
responsible vis-à-vis a given data controller, thus establishing a "one-stop shop" for 
data controllers. The decisions taken by the responsible DPA would have to be 
recognised and enforced in the other Member States concerned. It would, however, 
always be ensured that an individual retains the possibility of addressing 
himself/herself to the DPA of his/her Member State of residence, as well as – where 
appropriate – to the courts in the country of residence for proceedings against the 
controller or processor. 
• Increased harmonisation of the substantive rules at EU level - either by a directly 
applicable Regulation or by a "maximum harmonisation" Directive – by establishing 
 
EN 47   EN 
more prescriptive and more precise rules, thus reducing the margin for manoeuvre 
currently left by the Directive to the Member States.  
• Giving the Commission the competence to adopt implementing acts or delegated 
acts where there is a need for uniform implementation of specific provisions, or 
when there is a need to supplement or amend specific non-essential data protection 
provisions. This would allow the Commission to adopt detailed and specific rules 
covering certain aspects/sectors where the need may arise (e.g. application of 
security measures in various situations, application of data breach notification in 
specific circumstances, further specifying the conditions for data protection officers), 
while taking into consideration, wherever necessary, the relative position of micro, 
small and medium enterprises and the regulatory burden they incur in application of 
the "think small first principle". 
• Simplifying rules and procedures for transfers of personal data to third countries 
by giving the Commission exclusive competence for adequacy decisions, extending 
the scope of BCRs to include data processors and introducing a clear definition of 
"groups of companies". Moreover, prior authorisations by DPAs will be deleted in 
the large majority of cases. 
• Going a step further in co-regulation, by providing for the possibility for the 
Commission to give general validity within the Union, via implementing measures, 
to Codes of Conduct submitted by associations and other bodies representing 
categories of controllers in several Member States.  
Option 3: Detailed harmonisation in all policy fields 
This option would include all elements of option 2 (except the basic registration system) and 
include much more detailed EU legislation. The following additional measures would be 
added: 
• Abolishing the general obligation to notify data processing operations, currently 
foreseen by Article 18 of the Directive (and there would be no basic registration 
either. However, prior authorisation by the competent DPA would be maintained in 
cases of data processing likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of 
data subjects. 
• Developing an EU-wide certification scheme for data protection compliance for EU 
and third country controllers and processors, to be certified as complying with 
EU data protection rules. Such scheme could be based on appropriate standardisation 
by recognized standardisation organisations and should be supported by adequate 
monitoring, complaint processing and compliance mechanisms. 
Establishing detailed and further harmonised rules for specific sectors and 
circumstances (health and medical sector, employment relationships), based on 
relevant Council of Europe recommendations. In particular: 
– Employment relationships - key measures: 
a) Proportionality and legitimacy requirements mentioned in Articles 6 and 7 
of Directive 95/46/EC would be regulated in details for employment 
relationships. 
 
EN 48   EN 
b) the processing of data concerning health and the processing of drug and 
alcohol testing data by the employer shall in principle be prohibited, 
subject to limited exceptions; 
– Health/medical sector - key measures: 
c) personal data shall in principle only be obtained from the data subject (with 
very limited exceptions); 
d) persons subjected to genetic analysis should be informed of unexpected 
findings under specific conditions. 
5.1.2. Addressing inconsistent enforcement 
Option 1: Interpretation, technical support tools and encouragement of co-operation 
Under this option, the Commission would use soft policy instruments to improve the 
cooperation and coordination between Member State authorities and encourage more 
consistent application of EU legislation. This option would include in particular: 
• The Commission would adopt interpretative Communications in order to clarify and 
specify in detail the content of investigative and intervention powers of DPAs, so as 
to encourage a more uniform practice at national level. The notion of independence 
of DPAs would be further clarified in the light of Article 8 of the Charter and recent 
ECJ case-law. 
• Cooperation between DPAs would be improved by: 
– Extending the role of WP29 to include the competence to provide advice to 
DPAs and elaborate best practices on the application of EU data protection 
rules; 
– Providing them with practical tools, namely IT tools, to better exchange 
information (e.g. on complaints received, on investigations being carried out); 
– Funding from the EU budget would be made available in order to promote and 
encourage common training and the exchange of officials between DPAs. 
Option 2: Reinforcement and harmonisation of DPA powers and strengthened co-
operation between DPAs 
The shortcomings identified would be directly addressed by specific legislative changes, 
namely: 
• Reinforcing DPAs and harmonising their tasks and powers and obliging Member 
States through the EU legal instrument to provide adequate resources. This would 
include, in particular: 
– Further strengthening their independence and further harmonising DPAs’ 
tasks and powers to enable them to carry out investigations, take binding 
decisions and impose effective and dissuasive sanctions; 
– Establishing a legal basis detailing the obligations for co-operation and mutual 
assistance between DPAs, including the obligation for a DPA to carry out 
 
EN 49   EN 
investigations and inspections upon request of other DPAs. 
 
• Harmonising data protection offences subject to administrative sanctions as well as 
the level of sanctions. Supervisory authorities should be empowered to respond to 
specifically listed data protection violations by way of administrative sanctions; the 
offences which are to be subject to such sanctions would be harmonised at EU level.  
• Replacing the current WP29 by a European Data Protection Board, with a 
strengthened role and tasks, in particular in order to ensure a more consistent 
enforcement (see below). 
• Setting up a consistency mechanism at EU level which will ensure that decisions 
taken by a DPA with a wider European impact take full account of the views of other 
concerned DPAs. This system would foresee a role for the Commission and for the 
European Data Protection Board, in order to ensure consistency and compliance 
with EU rules. More specifically: 
– The Commission and the European Data Protection Board would be informed 
about national DPA draft measures in cases where such decisions would have a 
"European impact". The Board would have the opportunity to issue an opinion 
on the matter, to be taken into account by the concerned DPA. The 
Commission would also be able to adopt an Opinion on the draft DPA 
Decision and, as a last resort, a reasoned Decision requesting the concerned 
DPA to suspend the adoption of its draft measure, where required to ensure full 
compliance with Union law. 
– This suspension could last up to 12 months, during which the Commission may 
decide to adopt implementing measures to ensure the correct and consistent 
application of EU rules. 
• Ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the new European Data Protection 
Board by establishing the EDPS as responsible for providing the Board secretariat 
(instead of the Commission).  
Option 3: Centralised enforcement and EU-wide harmonised sanctions  
Option 3 would foresee the establishment of a centralised EU-level enforcement structure 
ensuring the functioning of personal data protection in the internal market by:  
• Establishing a central EU Data Protection Authority (i.e. a new EU regulatory 
agency) responsible for the supervision of all data processing with an internal market 
dimension, which could also take binding decisions vis-à-vis data controllers. 
• Defining harmonised EU-wide criminal sanctions for breaches of data protection 
rules. 
 
EN 50   EN 
5.2. Options to address Problem 2: Difficulties for individuals in exercising their 
data protection rights effectively 
5.2.1. Addressing individuals' insufficient awareness and loss of control and trust 
Option 1: Interpretation, information and encouragement of self-regulation 
The Commission would focus on using soft policy instruments to improve the practical 
implementation of existing rules by data controllers and the awareness of individuals, and 
make limited legislative proposals clarifying some existing concepts of the Directive. This 
would include in particular: 
• Awareness-raising activities for individuals, particularly children. In terms of 
enhancing the effectiveness of individuals' rights, the focus under this policy option 
would be on non-regulatory measures namely awareness-raising activities on data 
protection matters, particularly vis-à-vis children, namely by increasing EU funding 
for such activities. 
• Promoting privacy-friendly default options, greater uptake of Privacy Enhancing 
Technologies (PETs) and encouraging privacy certification scheme/privacy seals, 
research activities including on behavioural economics to help design privacy-
friendly applications. This would be achieved by increasing the EU financing for 
studies and research in the above areas. 
• The only regulatory measures under this option addressing this problem would be 
the introduction of explicit references to the principles of transparency and data 
minimisation in the relevant instruments, aiming at clarifying existing principles in 
the current legislation. 
Option 2: Legislative amendments to reinforce responsibility of data controllers and 
processors  
This option focuses on targeted legislative amendments directly addressing specific issues for 
which the need for regulatory clarification and increased precision has been established. It 
also includes the measures from option 1 introducing transparency and data minimisation as 
explicit data protection principles: 
• Further clarifying the concept of personal data by better specifying what identified 
or identifiable natural person means, using wording from current recital 26 of the 
Directive and including an explicit reference to online identifiers. 
• Clarifying the rules on consent, in particular by specifying that – where consent is 
the legal ground for data processing – it should be given explicitly (i.e. by either a 
statement or a 'clear affirmative action' by the data subject) and that the data 
controller should be able to demonstrate it.  Moreover, the data subject should be 
able to withdraw his/her consent at any time. Furthermore, the context of the consent 
should allow a genuine and free choice and in particular it should be excluded as a 
ground for lawful processing in case of significant imbalance between data controller 
and data subject (e.g., in the framework of an employment relationship). 
 
EN 51   EN 
• Including genetic data into the category of "sensitive data" (i.e., data whose 
processing is prohibited as a rule, with exceptions and derogations) and better 
framing the exceptions to the processing of sensitive data, particularly health data. 
• Provide for specific rules regarding the application of data protection rules to 
children's data, e.g. concerning the information given to them and the data subject's 
right to request that data be erased or rectified ("right to be forgotten") and the 
prohibition of automated profiling for children. Specific rules on consent for 
children below 13 years in the online environment – specifying that parental 
consent would always be required - would also help protecting a very vulnerable 
category of children because of their young age.  
• Clarifying the rules applying to data processing by individuals for purely private 
purposes ("household exemption"). In this case, when the processing has no gainful 
interest and concerns a 'definite' number of individuals they would be totally 
exempted from data protection rules. . 
• Strengthening data controllers' and processors' responsibility and accountability, 
namely by: 
– providing for additional obligations for data controllers, i.e. they will have to 
provide more mandatory information to individuals about the processing of 
their data, and in an intelligible form, using clear and plain language, in 
particular for privacy statements. In addition to what is currently provided for 
by the Directive, data subjects would have to be better informed about the 
processing operations, e.g. clearly indicating the period for the storage of the 
data plus the contact details of the controller, of the controller's representative 
and of the DPO (if any), as well as about their own rights, including their right 
to address themselves to a supervisory authority, along with the authority's 
contact details; 
– Given the increasingly role played by data processors in today's environment, 
some of the obligations of the controller would also be extended to the 
processor, which are currently only bound to respect the instructions of the 
controller via contractual obligations. The same requirements should apply to 
data processors based in third countries that are processing EU data as laid 
down in a contract with the controller or prescribed by a legal act. 
– Introducing the mandatory appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) 
for public authorities, for companies above 250 employees and those whose 
core business involves risky processing. Conditions would be set to ensure the 
independence of the DPO from the data controller as regards the performance 
of his/her duties and tasks. It will also be clarified that where the controller or 
processor is a public authority or body the DPO can be appointed for several of 
its entities, taking account of the organisational structure of the public authority 
or body. Even in cases where a DPO is not required, a register on data 
processing activities should be kept by the data controller; 
 
EN 52   EN 
– Introducing Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) with narrowly 
defined applicability criteria for processing operations likely to present specific 
risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. 
– Introducing a “Data protection by design” principle (i.e. the controller would 
be obliged to design the organisational structure, technology and procedures in 
a way that it meets the requirements of data protection);   
Introducing a general obligation, extended to all sectors (currently this is only 
harmonised for the telecommunications sector and regulated by the e-Privacy 
Directive), to notify data breaches to DPAs and to individuals in cases of breaches 
likely to adversely affect them. The controller will be obliged to notify the breach to 
DPAs without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 24 hours after 
having become aware of it. After notifying the DPA, the controller will also be 
obliged to inform individuals without undue delay about the breach. The 
thresholds and criteria for notification to both Data Protection Authorities and 
concerned individuals would be defined in implementing measures to be adopted by 
the Commission.  
Option 3: More detailed rules at EU level  
This option includes all the measures from option 2, as well as the following further 
measures: 
• In addition to the strengthened modalities of consent, under this option consent 
would become the "primary ground" for data processing. This would thus 
introduce a hierarchy of legal grounds for processing personal data, of which consent 
would be the primary one and all the other existing ones would remain as residual 
grounds. 
Adding further categories to the list of sensitive data, namely: 
– data relating to children; 
– biometric data; 
– and financial data, e.g. financial messaging data, credit histories and financial 
solvency (bad debtors lists) data contained in credit bureaux’ “scoring” 
systems; 
• Introducing harmonised EU-level criminal sanctions for breaches of data protection 
rules (see also problem 1) and would establish minimum rules with regard to the 
definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of personal data protection. 
• Specifying detailed thresholds and criteria for notifying breaches to data subjects, 
i.e., sectoral criteria, procedures and formats for notifying breaches to data subjects. 
• Developing EU-wide certification schemes on data protection (see also problem 1). 
5.2.2. Addressing the difficulty for individuals to exercise their data protection rights 
Option 1: Interpretation and standardisation 
 
EN 53   EN 
The Commission would rely on soft policy measures and limited legislative amendments 
addressing the insufficient awareness and loss of control referred to in the previous section 
and in addition: 
• Publish interpretative Communications regarding the interpretation and the 
modalities of exercising individuals' rights to data protection, e.g. clarifying that the 
right of access to one's own data should be exercised free of charge. Particular focus 
would be on data subjects' rights in the online environment. 
• Mandate standardisation institutions to develop standards for technical and 
organisational measures improving the protection of personal data. These standards 
should address general issues, such as methodologies and procedures, assessment 
criteria and techniques, as well as specific technological and sectoral elements. 
Option 2: Legislative amendments to clarify and strengthen individuals' rights and 
how they can be exercised 
This option focuses on targeted legislative amendments addressing directly the need for 
regulatory clarification and precision, in particular: 
• In order to enhance control by individuals over their own data, the existing 
provisions on modalities for access, rectification and deletion would be clarified 
and strengthened. As regards the exercise of these rights, it would be provided that 
the controller's actions in response to the data subject's requests should be in 
principle free of charge and a deadline would be set for the data controller to respond 
to requests. The right of an individual to have its data deleted when it is no longer 
needed and that wrong data is rectified could be spelled out more clearly in the legal 
instrument, making their execution practicable. 
• Introducing a right to data portability, giving individuals the possibility to withdraw 
their personal data from a service provider and process them themselves or transfer 
them to another provider, without hindrance from the controller. Individuals should 
have the right and the practical possibility to obtain a copy of the data processed by a 
data controller on the basis of their consent, and where this is technically feasible and 
appropriate, to have their data transferred from one service provider to another one. 
The data should be provided in a format that allows further processing either by the 
individual itself. 
• Strengthening the right of individuals to have their personal data deleted ("right to 
be forgotten"), particularly in the online environment. As regards deletion of data, 
clarifications as to the duties of the data controller would be included in order to 
strengthen the right of the data subject to have his/her data deleted when there are no 
longer lawful grounds to retain them ("right to be forgotten"), also clarifying that 
the burden of proving the need for further conservation of the data lies with the data 
controller. 
• Strengthening the provisions on judicial redress for data subjects, namely by 
making more explicit and clarifying the right for data protection authorities and 
associations aiming to promote the protection of personal data to bring action before 
courts on behalf of data subjects. This would, however, not amount to collective 
 
EN 54   EN 
redress and the associations would not be entitled to act on their own behalf, except 
in case of data breaches. 
Option 3:  EU level sectoral rules and redress mechanisms 
This would include the measures from option 2, as well as: 
• Specific provisions regulating in detail how to deal with  online identifiers and geo-
location data. 
• Introducing a right for collective redress regarding breaches of the protection of 
personal data. A general possibility for a collective legal action system in the area of 
protection of personal data (both injunctive and compensatory) would be introduced, 
allowing business and professional organisations and trade unions to represent 
individuals and bring actions before courts, by setting its basic procedural features 
including procedural guarantees for the parties and provide for the enforcement of 
judgements issued in other Member States. 
5.3. Options to address Problem 3: Gaps and inconsistencies in the protection of 
personal data in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters 
There is no Policy Option 1 to address this problem. For the area of the "former third pillar", 
only regulatory intervention can be effective, given the current gaps in data protection and the 
shortcoming of the legal instruments regulating this area. Therefore, a soft and interpretative 
approach is not considered as appropriate and only options 2 and 3 are elaborated. 
Certain changes are not discretionary since they are the automatic consequence of the entry 
into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the abolition of the former "pillar" structure of the EU, 
namely: 
• The "lisbonisation" of the Framework Decision, i.e. the fact of giving the 
Commission and the ECJ full powers to monitor the correct application of the 
acquis in this area by Member States. Based on  Protocol (N°36) on transitional 
provisions annexed to the treaties111, this will happen either when the "former third 
pillar" acts – including the Framework Decision – are amended or in any case five 
years after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (i.e. on 1st December 2014)112; 
• The extension of the advisory powers of WP 29 to this area. 
5.3.1. Addressing gaps in the Framework Decision  
Option 2: Extending the scope of data protection rules in this area 
Under this option, the most important gaps of the Framework Decision would be addressed, in 
particular: 
• The extension of  the scope of the new legal instrument to cover domestic data 
processing: the scope of the data protection rules in this area would no longer be 
limited to cross-border data processing (transferring to or making available to 
                                                 
111  See Articles 9 and 10 of the Protocol. 
112  See, in particular, Article 10, paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
EN 55   EN 
competent authorities) – as it is currently the case – but would also cover domestic 
processing in line with Article 16 of the TFEU; 
• The  application of the general data protection principles to this area, in order to 
ensure full compliance with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and with 
the relevant case-law of the ECtHR and the ECJ. This entails, namely: 
• Stricter and more harmonised rules on purpose limitation, i.e. on limiting 
processing of personal data to the purposes compatible with those of its initial 
collection, with limited derogations from this principle;  
• More harmonised rules on international transfers by foreseeing that transfers in 
this area can take place only, as a general rule, where there is an adequacy decision 
by the Commission or where appropriate safeguards have been adduced by way of a 
legally binding instrument. In the absence of the latter, transfer can also take place if 
the competent authorities have assessed all the circumstances surrounding the 
transfer operation and provided appropriate safeguards. Further derogations allow for 
transfers in exceptional circumstances such as: a) when the transfer is necessary to 
protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person or b) to safeguard 
legitimate interests of the data subject; and finally, c) when the transfer is essential 
for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security (of a Member 
State or a third country).    
• Provide for the obligation to appoint Data Protection Officers. 
• Provide for stricter and more harmonised obligations to adequately inform the data 
subjects about the processing of his/her data, while providing for the necessary and 
proportionate limitations/exceptions to this principle (such as restricting or delaying 
the transmission of data), to take account of the specific nature of these fields (i.e. , 
to avoid obstructing official or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures; to avoid 
prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal 
offences or for the execution of criminal penalties; to protect public and national 
security; to protect the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others).   
• Provide for more harmonisation as to the criteria and conditions on the right of 
access of data subject- in line with Article 8 of the Charter – particularly in cases 
under national law where currently the data subject does not have direct access to 
personal data processed by police authorities and only has recourse to indirect access 
via the data protection supervisory authority.  Possible limitations to this right would 
be the same as for the right to provide information (see above). However, in case of 
refusal of access (or restrictions), the reasons shall be provided in writing to the data 
subject. 
• Add genetic data to the list of sensitive data, in line with the case-law of the 
ECtHR113. 
                                                 
113 See footnote 98. 
 
EN 56   EN 
• The codification of selected principles based on the Council of Europe 
Recommendations and best practices regarding law enforcement and data 
protection, in particular on the distinction between personal data of different 
categories of data subjects (e.g. witnesses, suspects, convicted persons), as well as 
between personal data based on facts, on the one hand, and those based on personal 
assessment, on the other hand.  
Option 3: More prescriptive and stringent rules 
In addition to the measures included in option 2, this would also require Member States to: 
- always ensure direct access to data subjects in this area; 
- include biometric data amongst sensitive data;   
- require the carrying out of a DPIA prior to the processing of data, in particular 
sensitive data, in large information systems. 
5.3.2. Addressing fragmentation 
Option 2: New instrument with strengthened and more harmonised rules 
• The application of the general data protection principles to this area (see above 
under § 5.3.1 for the specific measures) would also contribute to reduce the 
fragmentation and the legal uncertainty in this area. 
• Leave unaffected for the time being existing "former third pillar" instruments with 
specific data protection provisions, which would n remain "lex specialis". The 
Commission would prepare a report, after the entry into force of the new instrument, 
to assess the existence of any possible incompatibility and propose, where 
appropriate, specific amendments. 
 
Option 3: Full integration of general principles in former third pillar instruments 
This would include all elements of option 2 plus: 
• The immediate amendment  of all existing former "third pillar" instruments , to 
the extent that they contain data protection provisions incompatible with the new 
proposed rules in order to fully align them. .

6. ANALYSIS OF IMPACTS  
Following the standardized impact assessment methodology of the European Commission, 
this section summarises the expected impacts of the three policy options addressing objectives 
1 (to enhance the internal market dimension of data protection) and 2 (to increase the 
effectiveness of data protection rights) and the two policy options for addressing objective 3 
(to ensure a comprehensive EU data protection framework including in the field of policies 
cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). For the first two policy objectives, 
each of the three options is assessed for its effectiveness regarding each of the two policy 
objectives, its economic and financial impacts, including on the Union budget where 
appropriate, social impacts and effect on fundamental rights. All measures are assessed for 
their effectiveness regarding both policy objectives, where appropriate. For the third policy 
objective, the two options are assessed for their effectiveness regarding the policy objective 
and their economic and social impacts. Specific environmental impacts could not be identified 
for any of the options. A detailed assessment of the impacts of each measure is included in 
Annexes 5, 6, 7, and 9. The analysis is the basis for the choice of the preferred option 
which is defined in section 7. The impact on the simplification of the regulatory 
environment of the preferred option is summarized in section 7.4, given that the data 
protection reform is contributing to the Commission's Rolling Programme for simplification. 
6.1. Policy objectives 1 and 2: Enhancing the internal market dimension of data 
protection and increasing the effectiveness of data protection rights 
6.1.1. POLICY OPTION 1: Interpretation, technical support tools, encouragement of 
self-regulation and cooperation and standardisation  
a)  Effectiveness regarding Policy objective 1: Enhancing the internal market dimension 
 As regards the objective of harmonisation and clarification of the EU data protection rules, 
interpretative Communications of the Commission regarding the key concepts defined in the 
Directive would not be binding for the Member States and could therefore have only limited 
impact on reducing legal uncertainty and resulting costs. The Commission would have to 
apply this tool with caution in order to avoid the risk that data controllers or data subjects 
relying on the Commission's interpretation face legal problems in Member States that do not 
comply with its interpretation in its national law.  
 More self-regulation at EU level could help provide some additional legal certainty for data 
controllers and enable easier operation of specific sectors of the Single Market, in particular 
when enhanced by elements of co-regulation, such as formal recognition of the supervisory 
authorities. The establishment of EU level self-regulation mechanisms could, however, only 
be achieved meaningfully and effectively with a clear and harmonised legal framework as its 
foundation.  
More support for the use of PETs by data controllers, as well as increased standardisation of 
technical and organisational data protection tools and measures, would increase businesses' 
certainty about how to achieve compliance with legal obligations. 
Legislative clarifications regarding the principles of transparency, data minimisation, 
adequacy and BCRs would increase harmonisation and legal certainty and contribute to more 
consistent enforcement of data protection obligations. 
 
EN 64   EN 
As regards the objective of consistent enforcement (independence and powers of supervisory 
authorities), Commission communications would not overcome Member States' reluctance to 
change their national rules in order to allow for more harmonisation and more independence 
and consistent powers of DPAs.  
Enhanced coordinating tasks of the Article 29 WP, the provision of additional IT tools to 
facilitate sharing of information and cooperation between national authorities and EU 
programmes for common training and staff exchanges between DPAs would have a positive, 
though not major, impact on more consistent enforcement of the rules. However, this solution 
would have a limited impact on the problem of inconsistent enforcement as no binding 
mechanism would be in place to ensure actual cooperation and mutual assistance. 
b) Effectiveness regarding policy objective 2: Reinforcing individuals' right to data 
protection 
Soft policy measures, such as interpretative Communications (e.g. on aspects of exercising 
the right to access one's own data), awareness-raising activities and encouragement of more 
self-regulation could help improve individuals' awareness of their rights and better 
understand how to practically exercise their data protection rights. They would however not 
be sufficient for individuals to ascertain their rights effectively in the absence of a strong 
underlying legal framework. 
Data subjects' ability to exercise their rights would be slightly improved by introducing 
clarifications in the legal framework regarding transparency and the data minimisation 
principle. This would however only bring along limited improvement to individual's rights as 
it would not substantially improve rights of access, deletion etc, which are essential to 
enhance trust in the digital environment.  
c)  Economic and financial impacts 
The expected financial and economic impacts of this policy option are limited.  
For economic operators, measures under this option would provide some additional legal 
clarity but would not substantially reduce the costs and burdens linked to the current 
fragmentation of the regulatory environment. Moreover, continuing divergences in national 
interpretations and practices would still undermine individuals' trust in cross-border 
transactions and therefore limit their use of the online environment. 
This set of foreseen measures would give rise to some additional compliance costs for data 
controllers as introducing the principles of transparency and of data minimisation might 
require additional capabilities in processing data and controlling flows. These are however 
difficult to quantify as the current rules already contain, albeit less explicitly, such 
obligations, and many organisations have already implemented them in practice. Moreover, 
'data minimisation' is a sound data management principle. Raising awareness of its 
importance could yield benefits to businesses by helping data controllers avoid data overflow 
and mitigate the risks caused by security breaches. 
Budgetary impacts: the option would have an impact on the public authorities' both at EU and 
national level. It would include some additional compliance costs due to the establishment of 
the online platform for data controllers' notifications, the IT tool for exchanges of information 
between DPAs, and the programmes for best practice sharing and staff exchange between 
national supervisory authorities. The extended tasks for the WP 29 would lead to an increase 
 
EN 65   EN 
of the annual costs of its secretariat from the currently estimated costs of €1.7 million114 by an 
approximate minimum of 30%, i.e. an additional €0.5 million per year for the EU budget. 
EU funding would also be needed for awareness-raising activities to encourage the use of 
PETs and privacy certification schemes. In the period 2009-2010 the funding of projects 
under the Fundamental Rights programme, covering awareness-raising and other activities 
amounted to more than €800,000. A 25% increase could be envisaged to finance additional 
awareness raising projects and activities in the domain of data protection.  
Simplification: a single platform for notification of processing operations to national 
supervisory authorities would reduce administrative overhead for data controllers as it would 
simplify the process. However, this measure would not remove the additional administrative 
burden created by diverging national rules that would still need to be complied with. 
An amendment to the legal instrument streamlining and clarifying the adequacy criteria and 
procedures would accelerate the recognition process and have a positive impact on relations 
with third countries. Increasing the number of adequate countries would in turn reduce the 
current overheads for data controllers transferring data to third countries in the longer term. 
However, the costs linked to the current burdensome procedures related to transfers based on 
other grounds would not be reduced in the short term. Although providing a legal basis for 
Binding Corporate Rules would be a positive step to recognise and encourage the use of this 
tool as a means to facilitate transfers within corporate groups, this would not  be sufficient to 
address the shortcomings that currently limit their use (i.e. limitation of their scope).   
d)  Social impacts and Fundamental Rights 
By improving the capacity of individuals to exercise their data protection rights more 
effectively, this option would have a limited positive social impact regarding fundamental 
rights. 
e) Environmental impacts 
No impact. 
6.1.2. POLICY OPTION 2: Legislative amendments addressing gaps in current 
harmonisation, clarifying and strengthening individuals' rights and reinforcing 
responsibility of data controllers and processors, reinforcement and harmonisation 
of DPA powers and strengthening of their cooperation 
a) Effectiveness regarding policy objective 1: Enhancing the internal market dimension 
- Regulatory intervention improving harmonisation and clarification of EU data protection 
rules, including concepts such as personal data and consent, would significantly reduce legal 
uncertainty for private companies and public authorities. Consistency will be increased due to 
the reduced margin of interpretation and the implementing measures and/or delegated acts to 
be adopted by the Commission. These would be used in particular in cases where new 
technological or economic developments require a common approach to be adopted by 
authorities in all Member States. In recent years, a large number of such issues have arisen, 
where diverging approaches have been taken at national level and by the various DPAs. In 
contrast to the only instruments available for providing guidance at present - i.e. non-binding 
                                                 
114  The current figures for the secretarial costs are based on two administrators and one assistant working full time on matters related 
to the WP29. 
 
EN 66   EN 
opinions of the Article 29 Working Party – delegated or implementing acts by the 
Commission would be legally binding and thus provide legal certainty to data controllers. 
The increased harmonisation will be beneficial not only for large multinational enterprises 
operating in several Member States, but also for enterprises currently only operating in their 
domestic markets, including SMES, which are expected to welcome increased legal certainty 
and uniformity as a strong incentive to expand their operations cross-border. 
Two sub-options are possible in this respect: 
i) If the current Directive is replaced by a Regulation:  
- a Regulation, being directly applicable upon Member States, would achieve a very high 
degree of harmonisation of the rules, without the need for transposition into different national 
laws. It would also eliminate the need for defining criteria for applicable law, as the 
Regulation would be the applicable law across Member States. This is the option favoured by 
the great majority of economic operators, which consider it essential to ensure the desired 
legal certainty and simplification within the internal market. On the other side, this option 
would have a major impact on Member States, given the fact that most of them have 
developed an extensive and detailed national legislation implementing the Directive, covering 
both the private and the public sector.  
The current cost of legal fragmentation, only in terms of administrative burden, is estimated 
to amount to almost € 3 billion (see Annex 9 for details). These costs are incurred by 
economic operators processing personal data in several Member States and to which the 
different national laws and requirements are applicable. Replacing the Directive by a 
Regulation would have the effect of cutting such costs and drastically simplifying the 
regulatory environment.  
ii) If the current Directive is amended and made a "maximum harmonisation Directive": 
A very detailed Directive, further harmonising the applicable rules and reducing the room for 
manoeuvre left to Member States, could also help substantially in cutting the costs and 
administrative burden in the baseline scenario due to fragmentation. However, this would 
not eliminate the need for transposition by Member States and the differences in national 
transposition laws that this might entail. Moreover, there would always be the risk for "gold-
plating" from Member States. 
 
- Clarifying and simplifying the rules on applicable law  - even more if the single applicable 
law will be the EU Regulation - and on the responsible DPA by establishing a "one-stop 
shop" for data protection supervision will strengthen the internal market, including by 
removing existing differences in administrative formalities vis-à-vis DPAs and simplifying 
the requirements. This will have a major positive impact on data controllers, which will not 
have to be subject to different requirements and DPAs practices for the same data processing 
operations involving several Member States. 
- Replacing the general notification of data processing activities, while maintaining a 
simplified basic registration system (as well as prior checks for processing operations likely 
to present specific risks to rights and freedoms of data subjects), will relieve data controllers 
from a burdensome obligation currently implemented in a diverging manner. However, the 
basic registration would also entail additional administrative burden for data controllers in 
those Member States that already today largely exempt from the notification obligation.   
 
EN 67   EN 
- An EU-wide harmonised obligation to notify data breaches will ensure consistency and 
avoid the creation of diverging rules in the Member States. The definition of criteria and 
thresholds for notification is a key factor in determining the cost impact of data breach 
obligations on data controllers and requires an in-depth assessment and will thus be left to 
implementing measures. However, in order to avoid delayed notifications – particularly in 
cases where the breach is likely to have adverse consequences on the data subject – it is 
important that the notification both to the DPA (as a rule, wherever feasible, 24 hours from 
the point the controller becomes aware of the breach) and to the data subject is made without 
undue delay.  
- Simplifying rules and procedures for transfers of personal data to third countries  would 
have a positive impact on business as it would entail, in the large majority of cases, the 
elimination of the need for prior authorisations before transferring data to third countries. This 
is an important element to boost the international competitiveness of EU businesses (see also 
Annex 10). 
- Strengthening data controllers’ and data processors’ responsibility by introducing 
obligations to establish Data Protection Officers in organisations of a certain size and nature 
and to perform Data Protection Impact Assessments (with appropriate thresholds – see 
below) and introducing the principle of data protection by design will also offer easier ways 
to ensure and demonstrate compliance for data controllers and increase their legal certainty. 
- Consistency of enforcement will be fostered by reinforcing and harmonising DPAs’ powers 
– including the power to impose dissuasive and effective administrative sanctions - and by the 
establishment of a strong co-operation and mutual assistance mechanism between DPAs for 
cases with an EU dimension. The newly established "consistency mechanism" would ensure 
that a decision takes account of data subjects and data controller establishments in EU 
countries other than the one of its main establishment. Interventions by the Commission, 
based on the expert advice of the EU Data Protection Board would allow settling potential 
disputes. Increased competences of the Commission in particular through implementing 
measures and/or delegated acts would further strengthen harmonisation. Consistency of 
enforcement would also benefit from harmonising the offences subject to administrative 
sanctions. A streamlining of the advisory functions of the EDPS and of WP 29 (that would 
become the EU Data Protection Board and whose secretariat would be provided by the EDPS) 
would further increase consistency in the internal market and simplify the EU-coordination on 
data protection issues without the need of creating a new EU Agency. 
b) Effectiveness regarding policy objective 2: Reinforcing individuals’ right to data 
protection 
Legislative amendments improving harmonisation and clarification of EU data protection 
rules – both those strengthening controllers' responsibility and accountability and those 
clarifying and improving existing rights – would contribute to significantly strengthening 
individuals' control over their own data and the actual exercise of their rights. This is 
particularly true for legal provisions clarifying definitions ("personal data") and key concepts 
such as the modalities for valid consent, the right to have one's own data deleted ("right to 
be forgotten") or to withdraw and transfer it to other controllers ("data portability"). This 
will reduce grey areas where the rights of individuals are sometimes not properly respected.  
The explicit inclusion of genetic data as a special category of personal data requiring specific 
safeguards (“sensitive data”) would bring about an important positive impact for individuals 
as it would address the particular concern that genetic data is properly and securely dealt with 
 
EN 68   EN 
in all Member States. Equally, the harmonised approach would bring about positive impacts 
for those controllers who process genetic data as they could enjoy legal certainty for this 
processing in all Member States. 
Highly beneficial in terms of individuals' rights are also the provisions strengthening the 
protection of children's data. The additional burden for data controllers would be limited if 
from the very beginning, products and services are designed to include children-friendly 
privacy information and settings ("data protection by design"). The specific rules on consent 
in the online environment for children below 13 years – for which parental authorisation is 
required – take inspiration for the age limit from the current US Children Online Data 
Protection Act of 1998 and are not expected to impose undue and unrealistic burden upon 
providers of online services and other controllers. This would not interfere with Member 
States' contract laws, which would remain unaffected. The methods and modalities to obtain 
verifiable consent would be left to Commission's implementing measures.  
Strengthened rules on remedies and sanctions would also significantly contribute to enhance 
individuals' data protection rights. 
Simplifications regarding applicable law to choose only one law and one single data 
protection authority for data controllers active in several Member States may bring 
individuals in a situation where they interact with data controllers not directly responding to 
their national supervisory authorities. However, individuals will always the possibility to 
address themselves to the DPA (and the courts, for actions against the controller or the 
processor) of their country of residence. Moreover, individuals' legal position will be 
strengthened through the possibility for associations to bring proceedings before the courts 
on their behalf. 
On the basis of strengthened DPAs powers, the improved cross-border enforcement 
cooperation (particularly via the consistency mechanism) and the streamlining of the advisory 
functions of WP29 and EDPS will enable individuals to exercise their rights throughout the 
EU in a more consistent way and will provide them with a stronger mechanism to assert their 
rights in the internal market effectively. Strengthened administrative sanctions available to 
DPAs against non-compliant data controllers will contribute to ensure that individuals' rights 
are actually respected and enforced.  
Other administrative simplifications, such as the reduction of processing notification 
obligations and procedural conditions for transfers to third countries will not directly affect 
individuals possibility to exercise their rights, where it is ensured that data controllers and 
processors responsibility and accountability is respected, and individuals have transparency 
about the processing of their data and receive fast and comprehensive information on 
breaches of personal data protection. 
The introduction of DPIAs can contribute to improving transparency for individuals, as data 
controllers will be better informed about the risks connected to their data processing, and to 
the security of the processing of personal data, as data controllers and processors can better 
avoid privacy risks related to some types of processing and take mitigating measures for 
residual risks. This effect is further strengthened by application of the principles of privacy by 
design and data minimisation. Where they exist, Data Protection Officers often serve as the 
contact point for individuals regarding privacy concerns and are in a position to provide clear 
and comprehensible information on data protection issues, both individually and in public 
communication. 
 
EN 69   EN 
c)  Economic and financial impacts 
– Business 
These measures would bring important economic benefits within the internal market and 
create a more level playing field for businesses and foster their intra-EU and international 
competitiveness (see Annex 10).  
Data Protection Officers (DPOs) 
The obligation for larger economic operators only (more than 250 employees) to designate 
DPOs is not expected to create disproportionate costs, as DPOs are already common in large 
and multinational companies whose business is linked with the processing of personal data.  
Compliance costs are expected to amount to € 320 million per annum for large companies in 
total (see annex 6 for more details). Such costs could even be reduced in the scenario whereby 
groups of companies would appoint a single DPO for the group. SMEs would be excluded 
from this obligation, except if their core activity consists of processing operations which 
require regular and systematic monitoring. This would mean focusing on those activities 
which, by their own nature entail significant data protection risks. For example, this would 
concern head-hunters companies engaged in profiling activities. In such cases, this burden 
would be justified by the nature of the processing and the particular risks, as well as the added 
value for data subjects' rights of having a dedicated officer in place. Moreover, SMEs 
involved in such processing activities are expected to resort to ad hoc legal consultants for 
DPO services – as opposed to hiring/designating full time employees – which would limit 
their costs115.  
All companies would have to keep in any case a register of data processing operations. This 
would be a minimum requirement and is part of the routine internal administration and 
management of the business and would not constitute, in itself, an additional burden. This 
would also have an impact on data processors given the increased role of data processors in 
processing activities (e.g. in cloud computing applications). The above thresholds/criteria 
would apply also in this case. 
The requirement to designate a DPO in public authorities would entail a cost for Member 
States’ public authorities other than DPAs. It is difficult to estimate such costs given that 
many public authorities already have DPOs or corresponding functions (this varies between 
Member States).  
However, the fact that where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, the 
data protection officer may be designated for several of its entities, taking account of the 
organisational structure of the public authority, ensures that the financial burden imposed is 
not disproportionate and can be spread out between the administrative departments of a public 
authority in a cost-efficient way. 
Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) 
The cost of a DPIA inherently involves a case-by-case calculation, depending on the nature 
and scale of the exercise. However, this obligation would be foreseen only for those data 
processing presenting specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The threshold 
                                                 
115  In the context of the SME consultation (see Annex 8), approximately 47% of respondents either stated that there is nobody 
formally assigned in their company to deal with data protection issues, or responded "I don’t know / not applicable". 6% stated 
that there is a full-time employee dealing with data protection issues, and approximately 40% that someone carries out these tasks 
alongside other activities. 
 
EN 70   EN 
criteria for the applicability of this provision would be narrowly and precisely defined to 
ensure that its scope would not be disproportionately wide. Therefore, like for DPOs, most 
SMEs will be exempted from this measure. Actual costs, for those companies subject to this 
obligation, will necessarily depend on a set of variable criteria, including the size of the 
organisation and how significant the data protection impacts of a new technology, service, 
product, or proposed policy are expected to be. Annex 6 includes three case studies of DPIAs, 
differentiated by size and magnitude. It is estimated that a small-scale DPIA would cost 
€14,000, a medium-scale DPIA would cost €34,500, and a large-scale DPIA would cost 
€149,000.  
In terms of benefits to businesses, undertaking a DPIA can help to identify and manage data 
protection risks, improve the security of personal data, and avoid unnecessary costs (in terms 
of problems being discovered at a later stage and inadequate data processing solutions) and 
damage to trust and reputation. 
The burden would also not be unreasonable for public authorities, as a DPIA would not be 
required where the assessment of the impact on privacy and data protection of a certain 
processing activity or system has already been carried  out during the preparatory stage of the 
law on which such processing is based. 
Including a general principle of Data Protection/Privacy by Design without specific 
obligations is not expected to create significant economic impacts, as it only strengthens 
existing obligations. The Commission would be given the power to adopt implementing 
measures setting specific obligations, which will be subject to a separate assessment. 
Strengthening the criteria for making EU law applicable to data controllers/businesses based 
outside the EU – e.g. when offering goods and services to individuals within the EU,  or when 
monitoring them – could have a negative impact on them to the extent that EU rules on data 
protection are more stringent than in their country of establishment and may in some cases go 
as far as discouraging them from doing business in the EU. This is however essential to 
ensure that protection of EU individuals' data is not circumvented by a mere "outsourcing" of 
data processing activities in countries not ensuring an adequate level protection. 
Simplifying the rules for international transfers would, overall, have a positive impact on 
the international competitiveness of EU businesses. (see Annex 10) 
– Public authorities 
Strengthening DPAs’ independence and powers, together with the obligation for Member 
States to provide them with sufficient resources, would entail additional costs for public 
authorities that are currently not equipped with appropriate powers and adequate resources. It 
is difficult to estimate such costs in detail, given the differences in the size, available 
resources and sources of funding, tasks and powers of national DPAs. Costs will be higher for 
those Member States whose DPAs are currently not equipped with the appropriate tasks, 
powers and resources to ensure a common level of data protection in the EU. On the other 
hand, additional resources could derive from the increase of the powers to impose sanctions 
for breaches of data protection rules. 
The new cooperation and mutual assistance mechanism between DPAs to improve the 
effectiveness and consistency of enforcement would entail additional costs (including 
administrative burden) for national DPAs, as they would need additional resources to 
adequately cooperate and exchange information with other DPAs, in particular to: 
– Carry out checks, inspections and investigations as a result of requests from DPAs in 
other Member States; 
 
EN 71   EN 
– Have additional staff and mechanisms in place to investigate enforcement requests from 
DPAs in other Member States; 
– Enforce the decisions taken by DPAs in other Member States as part of the "one-stop 
shop" system of supervision. 
The additional tasks of the EDPS for providing the secretariat of the EU Data Protection 
Board replacing WP29 and in particular the involvement in the consistency mechanism are 
likely to require an increase of its current resources by an additional €3 million per annum on 
average for the first six years, including credits for additional human resources of 10 Full 
Time Equivalent (FTE). 
– Simplification  
The costs of current legal fragmentation for economic operators only in terms of 
administrative burden are estimated to amount to more than € 2.9 billion in total per annum. 
The expected net savings for economic operators would be around € 2.3 billion per annum, 
arising from the elimination of legal fragmentation and the simplification of notifications 
(basic registration). Clarifying the requirements for consent, as well as explicitly stating that 
the data controllers should be able to prove it (when required), will not entail significant 
additional costs, as the obligation to demonstrate that consent has been given, when the 
processing is based on it, exists already today. Thus, the purpose is not to introduce a (new) 
obligation for 'written consent' in all cases (a statement or clear "affirmative action" of the 
data subject would also be valid), but merely to clarify existing obligations  in order to 
harmonise the current divergent practices across Member States and give legal certainty to 
data controllers, who would otherwise continue to face fragmentation. The streamlining of the 
advisory role of WP29 and EDPS simplifies significantly the advisory process and accelerates 
the provision of coordinated guidance.  
d) Social impacts and Fundamental Rights 
These measures would give rise to significant positive social impacts, including the 
strengthening of several individual fundamental rights. 
e) Environmental impacts 
No impacts. 
6.1.3. POLICY OPTION 3: Detailed harmonisation and rules at EU level in all policy 
fields and sectors, centralised enforcement and EU wide harmonised sanctions and 
redress mechanisms.  
a) Effectiveness regarding policy objective 1: Enhancing the internal market dimension 
Adding further detailed legal provisions, including and beyond the measures envisaged in 
option 2 – i.e. making consent as primary legal ground, adding additional categories of 
sensitive data, envisaging specific and detailed rules for the execution of individuals' rights 
and establishing detailed and harmonised rules on specific sectors, such as health and 
employment - would lead to a maximum reduction of divergences between Member States. 
However, this would at the same time lead to an unbalanced situation, as there may be not 
enough flexibility for Member States to apply EU rules taking account of national 
specificities, which will make implementation difficult. As regards in particular issues 
without cross border impact, some flexibility is necessary for Member Sates allowing them to 
design solutions tailored to their specific issues. 
 
EN 72   EN 
The total abolition of notifications – while maintaining prior checks for risky processing - 
would greatly simplify the regulatory environment, reduce administrative burden and increase 
the consistency of enforcement. Having more harmonised rules would also contribute to 
pursuing public policies at EU level. 
An EU-wide certification system for data controllers' compliance with their data protection 
obligations would provide them with full legal certainty in an ex-ante verification process. 
Concerning the specification of detailed criteria and thresholds for notifying data breaches, 
US experience shows that the definition of such thresholds and criteria is a very complex and 
difficult exercise, and deserves an in-depth and specific assessment. 
As regards consistent enforcement, the setting up of an EU Data Protection Agency (which 
would be a new EU Agency) would improve the consistency of enforcement and solve the 
inconsistencies for cases with a clear EU dimension. The EU Data Protection Agency would 
take over from national DPAs the responsibility for supervision of specific cross-border cases. 
However, regardless the economic implications of setting up such an agency (see below), this 
could lead to a situation where an EU agency would enjoy discretionary competences which 
could go too far under EU law116. EU harmonised criminal sanctions would further 
strengthen this effect but would raise opposition a the recourse to criminal sanctions in this 
area is very rare. 
b) Effectiveness regarding policy objective 2: Reinforcing individuals’ right to data 
protection 
Data subjects' rights, including the rights of children, would be further strengthened 
(compared to the impacts under policy options 2) by extending the definition of sensitive data 
to include data of children, and biometric and financial data and more precise rules for 
specific circumstances and sectors (e.g. location data and online identifiers). More detailed 
rules on the modalities of exercising individuals' rights would strengthen these. 
Defining consent as a primary ground for data processing would not necessarily have a 
positive effect on individuals' rights as it may lead to numerous  and eventually "artificial" 
expressions of consent (i.e. not really specific, freely given etc). 
The definition of thresholds and procedurals elements of data breach notifications in the basic 
act instead of in implementing or delegated acts has no advantage for individuals.  
The introduction of a right to collective redress could allow maximising rights by means of 
litigation.  
A central Agency supervising the cross-border processing activities at EU level, a single 
contact point for individuals in many cases, would ease the exercise of their rights. However, 
national DPAs would remain competent for purely national situations.  
Additional strengthening of individual rights would be expected from harmonising the level 
of sanctions, including criminal ones, at EU level for infringements of data protection rules. 
The latter element would lower the threshold for individuals to pursue their rights also 
through legal action when administrative procedures do not produce a satisfactory outcome.  
An EU-wide certification scheme with clear and strictly applied criteria would provide 
individuals with a means to select data controllers for their transactions according to their 
                                                 
116   See Case 9/56, Meroni & Co., Industrie Metallurgiche, SpA v. High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, 1958. 
 
EN 73   EN 
degree of compliance. A certification for third country controllers dealing directly with 
individuals would also have a positive effect. 
c) Economic and financial impacts 
– Economic operators 
Making a hierarchy between grounds for processing with consent as the primary ground 
would make the processing of personal data more difficult, cumbersome and costly for 
businesses. Expanding the categories of sensitive data to biometric, financial and children’s 
data would also entail substantial costs as it would require data controllers to adapt their 
procedures and technical systems to more stringent rules concerning the processing of such 
data.  
Specifying detailed criteria and thresholds for notifying data breaches would provide more 
legal certainty but is also likely to impose undue costs on data controllers.  
As regards international transfers, the voluntary certificate/seal data controllers' compliance 
with EU data protection rules would benefit EU competitiveness and facilitate data transfers 
between the EU and third countries. 
– Public authorities 
While the elimination of the general notification requirement will benefit controllers and 
processors (see below), it will have a negative impact on those DPAs for whom this currently 
represents an important – if not exclusive – source of financing, such as the Information 
Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK. It may also make it more difficult for certain DPAs 
to maintain an overview of data processing activities. 
An EU-wide certification system would be a resource-intensive option. 
The budgetary impacts of setting up a regulatory EU Data Protection Agency would be 
significant. For comparison, the overall 2011 budget for the EDPS amounts to € 7.6 million, 
the EU Fundamental Rights Agency’s budget was € 20 million and that for the European 
Network and Information Security Agency was € 8.1 million. It is therefore expected that a 
regulatory agency for data protection would require a substantial annual budget in the range 
of € 7-15 million. 
– Simplification 
Abolishing notification or registration of data processing operations altogether would reduce 
costs and administrative burden for data controllers, amounting to € 130 million per annum 
only in terms of administrative burden plus the fee that may additionally be imposed..  
d) Social impacts and Fundamental Rights 
The social/fundamental rights impact would be generally positive also under this option. 
Impacts would be similar as under option 2, but right to an effective remedy would be 
enhanced thanks to provisions on collective redress. Many of the more detailed measures do 
not create additional positive impacts. 
It is expected that too detailed data protection legislation would not be easily accepted at 
national level as it would not leave enough flexibility for national social norms and cultural 
specificities (for instance in the employment sector, regarding surveillance of employees). 
 
EN 74   EN 
e) Environmental impacts 
No impacts. 
6.2. Objective 3: Enhancing the coherence of the EU data protection framework in 
the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters  
There is no Policy Option 1, as 'soft' action would not be appropriate to meet the objectives. 
6.2.1. POLICY OPTION 2: Strengthened specific rules and new instrument with 
extended scope  
a) Effectiveness regarding the policy objective  
The extension of the scope of the general data protection instruments to cover the area of 
police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters would have a positive impact on the 
objective of enhancing the coherence of the EU data protection framework. It would also 
contribute to eliminating gaps in particular by extending the scope of data protection rules in 
this area to 'domestic' processing.  
Individuals' rights would also be strengthened by setting minimum conditions for the right of 
access and providing stricter rules on purpose limitation. The codification of some principles 
from the Council of Europe Recommendation on law enforcement, including on genetic data, 
will contribute to the fulfilment of the objective.  
The establishment of a mechanism supporting common interpretations by extending the 
competences of the WP 29 and of the Commission in this area – as a consequence of the entry 
into force of the Lisbon Treaty- would further help to address inconsistencies and gaps. 
b)  Economic and financial impacts 
Impacts would mainly concern the public sector. There is no indication that better 
coordination, harmonisation and clarity of rules would require any additional resources; rather 
the use of existing resources could become more efficient. The impact of new obligations, 
such as the appointment  of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), would also be limited to the 
extent that the possibility is provided – as for public authorities in general - to appoint a single 
DPO for different areas, departments and offices (and not, for instance, one per each Police 
Office or Department). 
c) Social impacts and Fundamental Rights 
Clarification of provisions, reinforcement of individuals' rights and increased coordination 
would have a positive effect on individuals' fundamental rights, particularly on the right to 
data protection.  
On the other hand, the fact that rules are tailored to the nature and needs of law enforcement 
activities – by providing for exceptions and limitations to individuals rights when, for 
example, this is necessary to avoid disrupting investigations, to protect public security and the 
rights and freedom of others etc – will avoid interfering with and disrupting the activities of 
police and judicial authorities in the performance of their public interest's tasks.  
d) Environmental impacts 
No impacts. 
 
EN 75   EN 
6.2.2. POLICY OPTION 3: Extended specific rules and full integration of general 
principles in former third pillar instruments 
a) Effectiveness regarding the policy objective 
Explicit amendments of all instruments extending the general rules to the area of police and 
judicial cooperation in criminal matters, with limited derogations/specifications in line with 
the Charter, would have a very positive impact in terms of consistency and coherence of the 
rules in this area and of strengthening individuals' rights and would provide for a higher level 
of data protection.  
This would, however, have an important impact on existing forms of police and judicial 
cooperation as regulated in the specific instruments that would be affected and should not be 
attempted without serious evaluation. 
b) Economic and financial impacts 
As in option 1. 
c) Social impacts and Fundamental Rights 
The positive social impact in terms of enhancement of individuals' data protection rights 
would be slightly stronger than under option 1. Measures under this option could, however, 
undermine the work of law enforcement authorities and affect their capacity to effectively 
prevent and combat crime.  
d) Environmental impacts 
No impacts.

Limited Compliance costs 
• Streamlining and clarifying the adequacy criteria and 
procedures would accelerate the recognition process and 
would facilitate data transfers to third countries. Increasing 
the number of adequate countries would in turn reduce the 
current overheads for data controllers transferring data to 
third countries in the longer term.  
Administrative burden 
• Simplification of Notifications: a single platform for data 
controllers' notification would accelerate the process (but no 
substantial reduction of administrative burden 
 
Compliance costs 
• Continued divergences in national DP laws do not 
alleviate administrative burdens and disincentives cross-
border trade (both for businesses and individuals) 
• Introduction of data minimisation principle 
• Costs flowing from online platform for data controllers' 
notifications, IT tool for exchanges of information 
between DPAs, best practice-sharing programmes, and 
staff exchange between national supervisory authorities 
• Extended tasks for WP29 would increase annual 
secretarial costs from €1.7 million by an approximate 
minimum of 30%, i.e. an additional €0.5 million per 
year for the EU budget. 
• Costs to the EU budget for awareness-raising activities 
(children, PETs uptake, certification, etc)

Extensive 
Compliance costs 
• Increased harmonisation will create a more level playing 
field for businesses and foster their intra-EU and 
international competitiveness. 
• DPOs and DPIA increase data controllers' accountability, 
and will help identify and manage data protection risks, 
improve the security of personal data, avoid unnecessary 
costs and damage to trust and reputation. 
• Positive impacts on the international competitiveness of EU 
businesses through the simplification of rules for 
international transfers. 
Administrative burden 
• An estimated € 2.3 billion in the administrative burden of 
legal fragmentation will be virtually eliminated by the 
increased harmonisation.  
 
• Replacement of notifications by a basic registration system 
would reduce administrative burden linked to that of about 
50% (€ 65 million, fees excluded). 
 
Compliance costs 
• Obligation (where applicable) to appoint DPOs imposes some costs 
on business (estimated at €320 per annum for large businesses) 
• DPIAs (where applicable) impose costs on a case-by-case basis. It is 
estimated that a small-scale DPIA would cost €14,000, a medium-
scale DPIA would cost €34,500, and a large-scale DPIA would cost 
€149,000. 
• Strengthening DPAs’ independence and powers and resources, 
would entail additional costs for public authorities. It is difficult to 
estimate such costs in detail, given national divergences, but costs 
will be higher MS whose DPAs are currently under-resourced. 
• New cooperation and mutual assistance mechanism between DPAs 
would entail additional costs (including administrative burden) for 
national DPAs, in terms of additional resources.. 
• Additional tasks of EDPS for providing the secretariat of the EU 
Data Protection Board are likely to require an average increase of its 
annual budget by about €3 million, including additional human 
resources. 
Administrative burden 
• Introducing a general obligation to notify data breaches to DPAs and 
individuals imposes additional administrative burden estimated at 
€20 million per annum. 
• Introducing a general obligation for data controllers to be able to 
demonstrate  compliance with data protection law is estimated to 
impose additional administrative burden of approximately €580 
million per annum.

Far-reaching 
Administrative burden 
• The total abolition of notifications – while maintaining prior 
checks in case of risky processing - would greatly simplify 
the regulatory environment and reduce administrative 
burden by approximately €130 million per annum (fees 
excluded).  
 
Compliance costs 
• Eliminating the general notification requirement will have a negative 
impact on those DPAs for whom this currently represents an 
important – if not exclusive – source of financing 
• Making a hierarchy between grounds for processing with consent as 
the primary ground would make the processing of personal data more 
difficult, cumbersome and costly for businesses.  
• Expanding the categories of sensitive data to biometric, financial and 
children’s data would entail costs as it would require data controllers 
to adapt their procedures and technical systems to more stringent 
rules concerning the processing of such data.  
• Specifying detailed criteria and thresholds for notifying data 
breaches would provide more legal certainty but is also likely to 
impose undue costs on data controllers.  
• An EU-wide certification system would be a resource-intensive 
option. 
• Budgetary impacts of setting up a regulatory EU Data Protection 
Agency would be significant. For comparison, the overall 2011 
budget for the EDPS amounts to €7.6 million, the EU Fundamental 
Rights Agency’s budget was €20 million and that for the European 
Network and Information Security Agency was €8.1 million. It is 
expected that a regulatory agency for data protection would require 
an annual budget of approximately €7-15 million.

7. COMPARING THE OPTIONS 
7.1.1. Analysis 
7.1.1. Policy Option 1 
Measures under Policy Option 1 would lead to low levels of compliance and administrative 
costs, especially for private data controllers, as most of the additional costs would fall on 
national and EU public authorities (e.g. financing for awareness-raising activities, 
encouragement of PETs and of privacy certification schemes). 
However, at the same time it would only have a limited positive impact on the identified 
problems and on achieving the policy objectives. 
In terms of political feasibility, although the policy proposals that have been included in 
Policy Option 1 are generally not controversial, this policy option is likely to be met with 
resistance by stakeholders as a result of its limited scope and impact on the problems, and 
would be considered as not ambitious enough. 
7.1.2. Policy Option 2 
As regards the first and second objectives, measures under Policy Option 2 are a 
considerably further-reaching and more ambitious package of proposals, particularly of 
regulatory nature. It will lead to a significant reduction of fragmentation and legal 
uncertainty. It can be expected to have a much greater impact in addressing the identified 
problems and achieving the policy objectives.  
On balance, the compliance and administrative costs associated with the proposals included in 
this policy option are expected to be reasonable in view of the benefits and savings of about 
€2.3 billion in terms of administrative burden that can be achieved (see Annex 9).  
This option will ensure a better and consistent enforcement overall. The abolition of 
notifications in favour of a much simpler 'basic registration system' would also simplify the 
regulatory environment and reduce the administrative burden. 
As to its political feasibility and stakeholders' acceptance, it is expected to be positively 
received by economic operators, as it would reduce their overall compliance costs, 
particularly those linked to the currently fragmented rules. The strengthening of data 
protection rights would be welcomed by the data protection community and DPAs in general. 
The EP report on this issue has likewise called for providing a uniform and high level of 
protection of individuals, while Council conclusions have called for the new legal framework 
to provide for a higher level of harmonisation than the current one. 
As regards the third general objective, this option would contribute to achieving the 
objectives of ensuring more coherence and consistency of data protection rules in the area of 
police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by repealing the Framework 
Decision, and eliminating gaps in particular by extending its scope to "domestic" processing.   
7.1.3. Policy Option 3 
As regards the first and second general objectives, measures under Policy Option 3 are 
those having the greatest impact on the problems and on the achievement of the objectives. 
They include most of the measures in Policy Option 2, while being more far-reaching under 
 
EN 80   EN 
several aspects (e.g. more detailed rules on certain sectors, abolition of notifications and the 
establishment of a European Data Protection Agency). 
They would therefore have a high and positive impact in terms of both reducing costs linked 
to legal fragmentation and enhancing individuals' rights. Moreover, it would maximise the 
consistency and coherence of data protection rules in the former third pillar and raise the data 
protection standards in that context.  
However, some of the measures included under this option either have high compliance costs 
or are likely to encounter a strong opposition from stakeholders.  
As to the third general objective, Policy Option 3 may raise difficulties: the simultaneous 
amendment of all former third pillar instruments would be very complex and politically 
unfeasible, as Member States will not accept endangering existing forms of cooperation 
between law enforcement authorities without an in-depth assessment, involving them, of any 
envisaged modification. 
It would therefore be, overall, a rather controversial option with some measures raising 
strong opposition from stakeholders.

7.3. Preferred Option 
The Preferred Option consists of most of the measures of Policy Option 2, which are those 
most likely to ensure the achievement of public policy objectives without excessive 
compliance costs, combined with: 
– One key element of Policy Option 3: the abolition of the notification obligations 
(except in cases of prior checks: risky processing), which would simplify the regulatory 
environment further and totally eliminate the administrative burden required by this 
obligation (which would partly remain with a basic registration system). This is called 
for by a large majority of stakeholders and would have a limited negative impact on 
some DPAs (see under § 6 above); 
– Some soft measures from Policy Option 1: the encouragement of greater uptake of 
PETs and privacy certification schemes and awareness-raising activities for individuals, 
particularly children. 
Table 4 - Summary of preferred Policy Option  
Problem Preferred Policy Option  
 
PROBLEM 1: -
Barriers for 
business and public 
authorities due to 
fragmentation, 
legal uncertainty 
and inconsistent 
enforcement 
General Objective: 
To enhance the 
internal market 
dimension of data 
protection 
• Abolishing notifications of processing operations altogether, while 
maintaining prior checks for  risky processing requiring prior checking (from 
Policy Option 3)  
• Simplifying the provisions on applicable law, to ensure that data controllers 
are always subject to legislation of one Member State only (or EU 
Regulation) and supervision of only one supervisory authority; 
• Amending substantive rules to remove explicit margins for manoeuvre for 
Member States and increase clarity and precision of the rules in general; 
• Giving the Commission the competence to adopt implementing acts or 
delegated acts where there is a need for uniform implementation of specific 
provisions, or when there is a need to supplement or amend specific non-
essential data protection provisions, ensuring that the interests of SMEs are 
taken into account when these measures are developed (in accordance with 
the "think small first" principle). 
Simplifying rules and procedures for transfers of personal data to third 
countries by giving the Commission exclusive competence for adequacy 
decisions, introducing more flexibility, extending the scope of BCRs to include 
data processors and introducing a clear definition of "groups of companies". 
Moreover, prior authorisations will be deleted in the large majority of cases.. 
• Introducing specific provisions to safeguard the competitiveness of the EU 
economy and take into account the relatively weaker position of SMEs in 
markets, in the context of:  information requirements; responsibilities of the 
data controller  and joint controllers; documentation to be kept by 
controllers; notification of data breaches to the data subject; data protection 
impact assessments; processing of health data; and administrative sanctions. 
• Reinforcing and harmonising DPA tasks and powers and obliging Member 
States through the EU legal instrument to ensure provide adequate resources; 
• Harmonising offences subject to administrative sanctions, with low 
minimum thresholds to prevent unrealistic sanctions on SMEs; 
• Providing for mutual recognition of DPAs' decisions and increased co-
operation via a consistency mechanism and mutual assistance operated, 
under the supervision of the Commission, through a European Data 
Protection Board  with a possibility for the Commission to intervene to 
 
EN 2   EN 
ensure swift compliance with EU law; 
• Ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the new European Data 
Protection Board by establishing the EDPS as responsible for its secretariat 
(instead of the Commission). 
• Encouragement of awareness-raising activities for SMEs to ensure adequate 
knowledge and understanding of the new legal framework 
 
PROBLEM 2: 
Difficulties for 
individuals to stay 
in control of their 
personal data 
General Objective: 
To increase the 
effectiveness of the 
fundamental right 
to data protection 
 
• Funding of awareness-raising activities for individuals, particularly children 
(from Policy Option 1)  
• Encouraging greater uptake of Privacy Enhancing Technologies by business 
and voluntary privacy certification schemes/privacy seals (from Policy 
Option 1) 
• Further clarifying the concept of personal data; 
• Clarifying the modalities for  consent; 
• Including genetic data into the category of "sensitive data" and harmonising 
exceptions to the processing of sensitive data; 
• Clarifying the application of rules including for children (e.g. in the context 
of the right to be forgotten, clearer information, prohibition of profiling); 
• Clarifying provisions relating to processing by individuals for private 
purposes ("household exemption"); 
• Strengthening data controllers' responsibility and accountability, including 
by extending data controllers' obligations to data processors and creating 
stronger transparency obligations for data controllers (e.g. giving individuals 
clear and intelligible information); 
• Introducing Data Protection Officers (DPOs) for public authorities, 
companies above 250 employees and companies performing risky 
processing (i.e. excluding micro- enterprises and SMEs not involved in risky 
processing); 
• Introducing Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)  for processing 
operations likely to present specific risks, e.g. when processing biometric 
data; 
• Introducing a “data protection by design” principle; 
• Introducing a general obligation to notify data breaches to DPAs within 24 
hours after becoming aware of the breach (if feasible), and without undue 
delay to individuals.  
• Strengthening and harmonising provisions on how individuals can exercise 
their rights of access and rectification to personal data (e.g. free of charge); 
• Introducing a right to data portability, giving individuals the possibility to 
withdraw their personal data from a service provider and process them 
themselves or transfer them to another provider, as far as this is technically 
feasible; 
• Strengthening the right of individuals to have their personal data deleted 
("right to be forgotten"); 
• Strengthening the right of associations to bring action before courts on 
behalf of individuals;. 
PROBLEM 3: 
Gaps and 
inconsistencies in 
the protection of 
personal data in the 
field of police and 
judicial 
cooperation in 
• Extended scope of rules in this area to cover domestic data processing; 
• Stricter rules on limiting data processing to the purposes compatible with 
those of its initial collection; 
• Providing minimum conditions for the right of access for individuals; 
• Adding genetic data to the categories of sensitive data, 
• Codifying selected principles based on the Council of Europe 
Recommendations and best practices regarding law enforcement and data 
protection (e.g. distinction between categories of data subjects); 
 
EN 3   EN 
criminal matters  
General Objective: 
Enhance the 
coherence of the 
EU data protection 
framework 
 
• Establishing mechanisms fostering common interpretation at EU level 
(extended competence of the WP29 and the Commission). 
 
The Preferred Option is estimated to reduce overall administrative burden by about €2.3 
billion per annum. Most of this reduction will come from the important reduction of 
fragmentation in national data protection rules, which currently imposes significant 
compliance costs on economic operators and affects the free flow of personal data in the EU. 
It will hence have significant positive impacts on the EU internal market. 
The Preferred Option is also expected to substantially strengthen data subjects' rights and 
the control over their data – including in the area of police cooperation and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters thus enhancing the fundamental right to data protection and at 
the same time effective police and justice cooperation. 
Some additional compliance costs are expected to accrue from the strengthened data 
protection rules, but a strong data protection regime in Europe can offer a competitive 
advantage for the European economy. The Eurobarometer survey117 and other sources118 
suggest that consumers are more likely to patronise businesses with strong privacy and data 
protection records. Studies also indicate that loss of customers accounts for 60% of the total 
costs of a data breach119. Privacy and data protection can increase consumer confidence. 
The Eurobarometer survey finds that fewer than four in ten Europeans trust shops, department 
stores, phone companies, mobile phone companies, internet service providers, and internet 
companies to protect their data.120 Enhanced data protection could enable European 
companies to capture the market share of Europeans who do not shop online because of a 
lack of trust that their information is secure, win customers who leave organisations with 
poor data protection records and retain their existing customers. 
Requiring companies to adopt high standards of data protection can also lead to long-term 
improvements for European businesses. Non-EU companies which do not have appropriate 
standards will be limited in their ability to operate within the EU, and European companies 
will be at the forefront if similarly high standards are adopted in third countries. Thus, 
regulation could act as a stimulus to innovation and to data protection-friendly business 
models. Furthermore, strong data protection regimes could offer an opportunity to innovate in 
other ways. For example, privacy enhancing technologies or privacy by design and data 
protection consulting are sectors which could benefit from an environment where enhanced 
data protection is the norm. European industry could become world leaders in privacy 
enhancing technology or privacy by design solutions, drawing business, jobs and capital to 
the European Union (see also Annex 10 on the impact of the preferred option on 
competiveness).

The Preferred Option includes a balanced solution also in relation to problem 3, as it 
strengthens individuals' rights, eliminates gaps and reduces inconsistencies as regards data 
protection in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, while limiting the 
potentially high impacts – vis-à-vis Member States' law enforcement authorities – that would 
derive from an immediate amendment of all ex-third pillar instruments.  
7.4. Impacts on simplification of the Preferred Option  
The data protection reform package forms part of the Commission’s rolling simplification 
programme. The simplification will benefit individuals, private sector operators, public 
authorities, including police and judicial authorities in particular by bringing the following 
improvements: 
– enhanced legal certainty as regards applicable rights and obligations, reduction of the 
current legal fragmentation, and reduction of costs and administrative burden caused by 
them;  
– simplification of the regulatory environment by streamlining obligations and 
procedures involved in protecting personal data with more focus on risky processing 
activities; 
– clearer rights for individuals and clearer obligations for those processing personal data; 
– more coherence and consistency in the field of the former third pillar and as regards 
functions of the WP29 and the EDPS. 
As regards administrative burden, significant reductions will be the consequence, in 
particular, of the abolition of the notification system and of simplified procedures for 
international transfers. The "one-stop-shop" for data controllers will also greatly reduce 
compliance costs. Compliance costs and administrative burden related to the introduction of a 
principle of transparency, the notification of data breaches and the establishment of a new co-
operation and co-ordination mechanisms are justified by enhanced quality and efficiency of 
individuals rights. 
Table 5 below provides an overview of envisaged changes to the current regulatory 
framework which contribute to its reduction both in terms of enhanced quality and efficiency.

8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
This section describes the monitoring and evaluation that could be applied to assess the 
impact of the preferred option. The approach to monitoring and evaluation is outlined with 
respect to the three main problems that the preferred policy option will address. 
The first evaluation will take place 3 years after the entry into force of the legal instruments. 
An explicit review clause, by which the Commission will evaluate implementation, will be 
included in the legal instruments. The Commission will subsequently report to the European 
Parliament and the Council on its evaluation. Further evaluations will have to take place every 
four years. The Commission methodology on evaluation will be applied. These evaluations 
will be conducted with the help of targeted studies on the implementation of the legal 
 
EN 7   EN 
instruments, questionnaires to national data protection authorities, expert discussions, 
workshops, Eurobarometers, and so forth. 
The legal instrument will also explicitly provide that the evaluations will support the 
possibility for the Commission, to submit additional legislative or non-legislative proposals 
and/or implementing measures, if deemed necessary.

CURRENT EU LEGAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PROTECTION  
OF PERSONAL DATA 
 
1.  EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS  
Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines the 
fundamental right to the protection of personal data of every individual in a legally binding 
nature, and defines the basic principles for the protection of personal data. 
2. DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC  
Directive 95/46/EC121 is the central legislative instrument in the protection of personal data 
in Europe. Directive 95/46/EC is the legislative basis for two long-standing aims of European 
integration: the Internal Market (in this case the free movement of personal data) and the 
protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. In the Directive, both 
objectives are equally important.  
Directive 95/46 was a milestone in the history of the protection of personal data as a 
fundamental right, along the path paved by Council of Europe Convention 108 of 28 January 
1981. Legislation at EU level was essential because differences in the way Member States 
approached this issue impeded the free flow of personal data among the Member States. Its 
legal base was thus Article 100a/Article 95 of the EC Treaty. 
The Directive applies to and has been implemented by all 27 EU Member States, as well as 
the three EEA/ EFTA States: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Switzerland has also 
implemented the Directive for the Schengen relevant areas. In line with the Copenhagen 
criteria, all candidate countries are committed to transposing Directive 95/46/EC by the time 
of accession. 
The Directive develops and specifies data protection principles in order to achieve 
harmonisation throughout the EU. The principles of the protection of the rights and freedoms 
of individuals vis-à-vis processing activities, notably the right to privacy, which are contained 
in Directive 95/46, give substance to and amplify those contained in the Convention (and its 
additional protocol on cross border data flows and independent supervisory authorities, added 
only in 2001 after the implementation of the Directive). The Directive stipulates general rules 
on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data and the rights of the people whose data 
                                                 
121  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the 
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of 
such data, OJ 1995 L 281/31. 
 
EN 10   EN 
are processed (‘data subjects’). The Directive also provides that at least one independent 
supervisory authority in each Member State shall be responsible for monitoring its 
implementation. The Directive also regulates transfers of personal data to third countries: in 
general, personal data cannot be exchanged with a third country unless the latter guarantees an 
adequate level of protection. The Directive is technologically neutral, and its principles and 
provisions are sufficiently general, therefore its rules can continue to apply appropriately to 
new technologies and new situations.  
 
The Directive applies to both the public and the private sectors. Directive 95/46/EC does not 
apply to the processing of personal data in the course of police and judicial cooperation in 
criminal matters. 
3. "E-PRIVACY" DIRECTIVE 2002/58/EC 
Directive 2002/58/EC122 particularises and complements Directive 95/46/EC with respect to 
the processing of personal data in the electronic communication sector, ensuring the free 
movement of such data and of electronic communication equipment and services in the 
Union. It has been partially amended by the Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC.  
This Directive has also been recently amended by Directive 2009/136/EC123 as part of the 
overall review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, introducing in 
particular a mandatory personal data breach notification.  
This Directive, also, applies to and has been implemented by all 27 EU Member States as 
well as the three EEA EFTA States Island, Liechtenstein and Norway.  
4. DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (EC) NO 45/2001 
Combining the relevant features of Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC, Regulation 
No 45/2001124 regroups the rights of the data subjects and the obligations of those responsible 
for the processing into one legal instrument for the Institutions and bodies of the EU. It also 
establishes the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) as an independent supervisory 
authority for the EU institutions (see also Decision 1247/2002). The legal basis was Article 
286 EC.  
With the entry into force of Article 16 TFEU (replacing the former Article 286 EC), the 
                                                 
122  Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the 
processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector 
(Directive on privacy and electronic communications, OJ 2002 L 201/ 37. 
123  Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending 
Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications 
networks and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the 
protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on 
cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws, 
OJ 2009 L 337/11. 
124  Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on 
the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community 
institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data; OJ 2001 L 008/1. 
 
EN 11   EN 
scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 extends automatically to all data 
processing activities of Union institutions within the scope of Union law. The latter now 
contains both former third pillar and second pillar activities. Consequently, there is no legal 
need to formally update Regulation 45/2001 at present, but this cannot be excluded in the 
future, for legal certainty. 
5. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE AREA OF THE COMMON FOREIGN AND 
SECURITY POLICY 
Currently there is no specific EU legislation for the protection of personal data for Member 
States in the area covered by the common foreign and security policy. Specific rules for the 
protection of personal data may be laid down according to the newly introduced Article 39 
TEU for Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) issues, but for Member States only. 
The Commission applies, for all of its activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) 45/2001. 
For all measures that fall within the sphere of the Union, such as Union action implementing 
restrictive measures/sanctions, Member States apply the national provisions resulting from 
implementing the Directive 95/46/EC. 
6. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA IN POLICE AND JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN 
CRIMINAL MATTERS 
For the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters alone, the current data 
protection framework in the EU can only be described as a patchwork that is, consisting of 
different rights and obligations for Member States and individuals, and creating several data 
protection supervisory authorities125. Several instruments exist with specific data protection 
regimes or with data protection clauses. 
Since 2008 Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA126 aims at creating an EU general 
legislative framework for the protection of personal data in police and judicial cooperation in 
criminal matters. Implementation of the Framework Decision was due in November 2010. It 
applies fully to the UK and Ireland, as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, because it is 
a development of the Schengen acquis. It does not, however, replace the rules applicable to 
Europol, Eurojust, Schengen and the Customs Information System, and it does not create a 
single independent supervisory authority. This Framework Decision does not affect the 
Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic 
Processing of Personal Data, and the Additional Protocol to that Convention of 8 November 
2001127, which therefore remains relevant for some EU instruments relating to police and 
judicial cooperation which contain specific data protection regimes or data protection clauses. 
Protocol 36 on Transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon provides that in the 
case of the existing former third pillar acquis, the principle is the preservation of all legal acts 
so long as they are not repealed, annulled or amended (Article 9).  
The Commission has no infringement powers in the case of former framework decisions 
                                                 
125  For example: the DPAs at national level, the EDPS, and the Joint Supervisory Board for Europol, 
Customs, Schengen (with a common secretariat), plus Eurojust and its Supervisory Body.

processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; OJ 2008 L 350/60. 
127  See below under 2.7 
 
EN 12   EN 
(Article 10). Also, the powers of the Court of Justice are to remain the same with respect to 
those acts in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters which 
were adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. These transitional measures 
are to cease to have effect five years after the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. 
Declaration 50 concerning Article 10 of the Protocol 36 attached to the treaties invites the 
institutions, within their respective powers, to seek to adopt, in appropriate cases and as far as 
possible within the five-year transitional period, legal acts amending or replacing existing 
third pillar acts.

EVALUATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
 THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE  
 
9. CONTEXT OF THE EVALUATION  
The Commission's reports on the implementation of the Data Protection Directive 
95/46/EC128 found in 2003129 and in 2007130 that the Directive did not manage to fully 
achieve its internal market policy objective, or to remove differences in the level of data 
protection actually afforded in the Member States. Enforcement was also identified as an area 
where improvement was needed.  
This evaluation focuses on the implementation of key provisions of the Data Protection 
Directive since then. It is carried out in the context of the reform of the current acquis on the 
protection of personal data in the European Union. To address the question whether existing 
EU data protection legislation can still fully and effectively cope with the challenges, posed 
particularly by globalisation and new technologies, the Commission launched a review of the 
current legal framework on data protection, starting with a high-level conference in May 
2009.  
The conclusions in the present document are based on findings in this review as regards the 
implementation of Directive 95/46, including the analysis of Member States' legislation 
transposing the Directive into national law, on the basis of studies131, of opinions of the

10. KEY PROVISIONS OF DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC 
10.1. Definitions and concepts 
10.1.1.  The concept of "personal data" - Article 2(a) 
The concept of “personal data” is one of the key concepts in the protection of individuals by 
the current EU data protection instruments and triggers the application of the obligations 
incumbent upon data controllers and data processors. The definition of "personal data" covers 
all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, either directly or 
indirectly. This deliberate technique to define "personal data" used by the legislator in 1995 
has the advantage of providing a high degree of flexibility and the possibility to adapt to 
various situations and future developments affecting fundamental rights. However, although 
the definition of "personal data" and "data subjects" are almost literally transposed by the 
majority of the Member States into their national laws133, this broad and flexible definition 
leads to some diversity in the practical application of these provisions. In particular, the issue 
of objects and items ("things") linked to individuals, such as IP addresses, unique RFID-
numbers, digital pictures, geo-location data and telephone numbers, has been dealt with 
differently among Member States.  
 
For instance IP addresses, which identify computers on networks, are considered as personal 
data by some Member States, while by others they may be qualified as such only under 
certain circumstances.134 Only a few Member States have taken a clear regulatory approach 
assessing the status of IP addresses. Austria considers IP addresses as being personal data in 
the Austrian Security Policy Act. Laws in Cyprus, Italy and Luxembourg suggest the same, 
but within the context of electronic communications. According to the Bulgarian and Estonian 
Electronic Communications Acts, only a combined set of data which includes IP addresses 
constitutes, as a whole, personal data. Hence, public authorities in charge of Network and 
Information Security and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection as well as Computer 
Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), Internet Service Providers and the security 
industry have expressed concerns about legal uncertainty regarding the handling and

Market for the Information Society: New rules for a new age?, by DLA piper, 2009.

established by Article 29 of the Directive; the opinions of the Working Party are accessible under: 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/workinggroup/wpdocs/2011_en.htm. 
133   National laws of all Member State replicate the definitions of "personal data" and "data subjects" including, 
in some cases, the elements of recital 26 of the Directive133 (e.g. France, Slovenia, Spain) or other minor 
amendments. 
134 Case law on the circumstances in which IP addresses are considered personal data, by time.lex CVBA,

EN 15   EN 
exchange of IP addresses and e-mail addresses across organisations and borders to ensure the 
overall security of networks and information systems (e.g. to mitigate spam, botnets or 
Distributed Denial of Service attacks). 
 
In the absence of clear regulatory provisions, many national Data Protection Authorities 
(DPAs) provided guidelines and opinions on the matter. Some of them took the view that the 
processing of IP addresses does not fall within the scope of legislation implementing the 
Directive, as long as the addresses themselves are not linked to individuals or to PCs of 
individuals (e.g. Belgium, UK). The majority of DPAs point to the fact that sophisticated 
means allow, in most cases, the re-identification of users, and consider, in their opinions on 
this issue, that IP addresses themselves are personal data (e.g. Denmark, France, Germany, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Spain). Estonian, Slovenian and Swedish 
DPAs state that IP addresses are considered as personal data in combination with other data, 
which could allow linking a dynamic or static IP address to an individual subscriber. The 
Austrian DPA recognised dynamic IP addresses (which are assigned automatically, as 
opposed to static IP addresses) as personal data.   
 
National courts tend to consider IP data as personal data (e.g. in Austria, France, Germany, 
Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, UK); only few courts found that IP addresses were not personal 
data since they allowed identification of a computer but not its user (e.g. some courts in 
France135, Ireland136). ECJ case law on the confidentiality of electronic communications137 
does not refer to the status of IP addresses.  
 
Another major area of divergent interpretation relates to the circumstances in which data 
subjects can be said to be "identifiable", if they have been made "anonymous", so that data 
can no longer be related to the individual, or "pseudonymised", where data can only be linked 
to the individual if one is in possession of a decoding "key". In this regard, recital 26 of the 
Directive states that "the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous 
in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable". However, the assessment 
whether the data allow re-identification depends on the circumstances, available means and 
technological development. In several Member States, DPAs consider encoded or 
pseudonymised data as identifiable – and thus as personal data – in relation to the actors who 
have means (the "key") for re-identifying the data, but not in relation to other persons or 
entities (e.g. Austria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, UK). In 
other Member States all data which can be linked to an individual are regarded as "personal", 
even if the data are processed by someone who has no means for such re-identification (e.g. 
Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden). However, DPAs in those Member States

are generally less demanding with regard to the processing of data that are not immediately 
identifiable, taking into account the likelihood of the data subject being identified as well as 
the nature of the data.  
 
Digital pictures of properties held in a database are considered, in the Netherlands for 
example, as personal data, if used for valuation or taxation purposes. In Sweden, telephone 
numbers were considered as personal data, but in one case, under the previous law, subject to 
the condition that not more than one specific person used the phone.138 There are also cases 
where the notion of "personal information" referring to professional activities as personal data 
was challenged.  
 
Responding to these divergent approaches, the Article 29 Working Party issued an opinion on 
the concept of "personal data"139, clarifying, particularly, the elements of "any information", 
"relating to", and "natural person", and pointing to recital 26 of the Directive as an essential 
means for interpretation. On the specific issue whether IP addresses are to be considered as 
"personal data", the Working Party concluded that IP addresses should be considered as 
personal data particularly in those cases where they were processed for the purpose of 
identifying the users of the computer. This position is referred to by DPAs in several Member 
States (e.g. Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, and Romania).  
 
Although the present definition of "personal data" encounters divergent applications in 
Members States in some situations, especially as regards things linked to individuals, it would 
seem counterproductive to change the definition of personal data.  Specific issues such as IP 
addresses and geo-location data should be tackled on the basis of this proven concept, taking 
into account – as said in recital 26 of the Directive - of "all the means likely reasonably to be 
used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person". Detailed 
references to specific technologies would jeopardise the proven technological neutrality of the 
Directive and risk gaps when technology advances. 
 
10.1.2. The concepts of data "controller" and "processor" - Article 2(d) and (e) 
The concepts of data controller and data processor play a crucial role in the application of the 
Directive, particularly for determining the responsibility for compliance with data protection 
rules, the exercise of the rights of data subjects, the applicable national law and effective 
enforcement by the Data Protection Authorities. The definition of data "controller" in the 
Directive refers to the natural or legal person or body which - alone or jointly with others - 
determines the purposes and means of processing. "Processor" is defined as the natural or 
                                                 
138  See also the definition of "traffic data" in Article 2(b) of the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC, OJ L 201,

EN 17   EN 
legal person or body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. However, 
apart from rules relating to confidentiality or security of processing and for the controller's 
responsibilities as regards the data subject's rights, the Directive contains no comprehensive 
or detailed set of obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors.  
 
A number of national laws (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and 
Sweden) closely follow the definition of the "controller". Other laws provide for some 
variations: for instance, focusing on the determination of the "purposes" of the processing, 
either without any reference to the "means" (e.g. Austria) or with reference to the "contents 
and use" of processing instead of the "means" (e.g. Spain). Irish law defines the controller as 
the person who determines the "scope and manner" of the processing, without referring to the 
purposes, while Italian law provides a detailed definition of the controller as "either the entity 
as a whole or the department or peripheral unit having fully autonomous decision-making 
powers in respect of purposes and mechanisms", and also expressly "related to security 
matters". German law defines the controller as "any person or body which collects, processes 
or uses personal data for itself, or which commissions others to do the same".  
  
The definition of "processor" has been implemented by most national laws. Austrian law 
provides that if a processor carries out processing "other than as instructed", he/she has to be 
regarded as the controller in respect of that processing. Some Member States do not provide a 
definition of "processor", but cover this processing in definitions of "third party" or 
"recipient". German law covers in more detail processing "on behalf of the controller" and "on 
instructions".  
 
These divergences run counter the objective of the Directive to ensure the free flow of 
personal data within the internal market. This is true for a large number of sectors and 
contexts, e.g. when processing personal data in the employment context or for public health 
purposes. Different interpretations and a lack of clarity of certain aspects of these concepts 
has led to uncertainties with regard to responsibility and liability of controllers, co-controllers 
and processors, the actual or legal capacity to control processing, and the scope of applicable 
national laws, causing negative effects on the effectiveness of data protection.  
 
The lack of harmonisation is one of the main recurring problems raised by private 
stakeholders, especially economic operators, since it is an additional cost and administrative 
burden for them. This is particularly the case for data controllers established in several 
Member States, who are obliged to comply with the requirements and practices in each of the 
countries where they are established. Moreover, the divergence in the implementation of the 
Directive by Member States creates legal uncertainty not only for data controllers but also for 
data subjects, creating the risk of distorting the equivalent level of protection that the 
Directive is supposed to achieve and ensure. Also the provision on liability in the Directive 
(Article 23) focuses on the controller, without addressing the liability of the processor.  
 
 
EN 18   EN 
The lack of harmonisation is especially pertinent where more than one controller and/or 
processor are involved in processing operations located in different Member States that apply 
different rules for controllers and/or processors. In practice, due to the complexity of the 
environment in which data controllers and processors operate, and particularly due to a 
growing tendency towards organisational differentiation in both the private and the public 
sectors as well as the impact of globalisation and new technologies, these concepts became 
increasingly complex. Sometimes numerous controllers and/or processors are involved in the 
same processing operations. An example for this is behavioural advertising, where publishers 
rent website-advertising space and network providers collect and exchange information on 
users. Such "joint controllership" is covered by the definition of the "controller" ("jointly with 
others"). However, in such cases there is a need to clarify the sphere of responsibilities, 
including the duty of informing the data subject that his/her data are accessible by others and 
conditions of access to personal data. In case the controller is located outside the EU, 
additional problems arise in view of the determination and enforcement of the applicable law 
(see section 2.3) and the transfer of data to third countries (see section 2.11).  
 
These problems are amplified in the context of "cloud computing", whereby software, shared 
resources and information are on remote servers ("in the cloud"). In the context of cloud 
computing, a cloud user can delegate to a cloud operator the supply of storage, infrastructure, 
software and security. The internet makes it much easier for data controllers and processors 
established outside the EU to provide such services from a distance and to process personal 
data in the online environment. It is often difficult to determine the location of personal data, 
which is frequently replicated on all continents in order to improve its accessibility, and to 
enforce data protection rules particularly in situations where the controller targets services to 
EU residents but has no establishment or representative in the EU. This may involve the loss 
of individuals' control over their potentially sensitive information when they store their data 
with programs hosted on someone else's hardware. Cloud providers usually consider 
themselves as data processors; however, whether the cloud provider is to be regarded as a 
controller or processor depends on the circumstances. Due to the current limitations of 
encryption technologies, it is expected that the cloud provider will very often have full access 
to most personal data controlled by its customers. Also, the concrete implementation of the 
rights of the individuals, such as modification and deletion of the personal data, is frequently 
operated by the cloud provider's subcontractors. It is, therefore, important to clarify which 
controller in such situations is responsible for ensuring that the data subjects using online 
services can exercise their rights, independently from the place where the processing occurs, 
whether in a European or an international cloud.  
 
On 16 February 2010 the Working Party adopted an opinion on the concepts of "controller" 
and "processor"140, in which it assessed these concepts in detail, concluding that clarification 
of these concepts was called for in order to ensure effective application and compliance in 
practice, but also found that the current distinction between controllers and processors was 
relevant and workable.

EN 19   EN 
 
Although the definitions and concepts of "controller" and "processor" remain themselves 
relevant, they need to be clarified and detailed in specific provisions as regards the 
obligations, responsibilities and liability of both controllers and processors. Harmonised rules 
on the responsibilities of data controllers and processors, including the obligation to 
demonstrate compliance with their obligations, would foster legal certainty. Including in the 
case of more than one controller and/or processors being involved, it must be clear for the 
data subject whom to address to in order to exercise his or her rights. 
 
 
10.1.3. The concept of "consent" - Article 2(h) 
The definition of "the data subject's consent" in the Directive builds on the elements of "any 
freely given specific and informed indication" of the data subject's wishes signifying the 
agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him/her. Whereas national law in 
most Member States reflects these elements, several Member States require the consent to be 
"unambiguous" (e.g. Portugal, Spain, Sweden), given "expressly" (e.g. Cyprus) or "explicit" 
(e.g. Greece, Luxembourg). In some Member States, the consent for data processing must be, 
in principle, in writing (Germany, Italy). Poland requires a "declaration of will", which 
"cannot be alleged or presumed on the basis of the declaration of will of other content", but 
does not particularise the elements "free, specific and informed". On the contrary, some other 
Member States (e.g. France, Ireland, Romania and UK) do not provide a definition of 
"consent" in their national data protection laws. In practice, this leaves room for considering, 
in certain circumstances, that "consent" to the processing of (non-sensitive) data is implied, as 
it is the case in the UK. In some cases it is not even clear what would constitute freely given, 
specific and informed consent to data processing.  
 
These different approaches among the national systems – ranging from written consent to 
implied consent – create considerable discrepancies, which are relevant for ensuring 
"informed consent" of the data subject (see section 2.7). This situation is particularly 
problematic in cross-border situations, including the internet. "Consent" obtained under the 
law of one country and valid under that law, could be regarded as insufficient for subsequent 
processing in another Member State because it might not meet (additional) requirements of 
that law for considering "consent" as a valid legal basis. The scope of application of "consent" 
also needs clarification, particularly in relation to the requirement of "free consent" in specific 
situations where there is an imbalance between the position of the data subject and the 
controller, in particular in the employment context, due to the relationship of the 
subordination of the employee to the employer, or in the public sector. The opinions issued by 
the Article 29 Working Party cover specific situations such as cross-border data flows,141

114).  
 
EN 20   EN 
employment142, schools,143 and the medical sector144, but do not solve the problem of 
divergent national approaches. 
 
These discrepancies are brought into sharper focus in the online environment, where 
individuals are generally less aware of or certain about their rights, and are hence less capable 
of giving informed and meaningful consent to data processing. A critical question in this 
respect is whether the settings (default or otherwise) of most commercially available web 
browsers can actually be considered to deliver the informed consent within the meaning of the 
Directive. In the light of this debate and the discrepancies between Member States' national 
rules, the Article 29 Working Party issued, in June 2010, an opinion on behavioural 
advertising145, in which it states that "the settings of currently available browsers and opt-out 
mechanisms only deliver consent in very limited circumstances" and calls on "advertising 
network providers to create prior opt-in mechanisms requiring an affirmative action by the 
data subjects indicating their willingness to receive cookies or similar devices and the 
subsequent monitoring of their surfing behaviour for the purposes of serving tailored 
advertising."  
 
In view of the divergent approaches among national laws and the consequences deriving from 
these, there is a need to clarify and determine in more detail the conditions and rules on 
consent, in order to guarantee informed consent and to ensure that individuals are fully aware 
that they are consenting to a specific data processing.  
 
10.2. "Household exemption" - Article 3(2), second indent - and Freedom of 
information - Article 9 
10.2.1. The 'household exemption' 
Member States, businesses and individuals see online services as creating one of the main 
challenges to personal data protection. The internet makes processing easier and consequently 
vastly increases the audience and the volume of data processed; this also results in the 
increased risks for data subjects when using such applications. Surveys show that most 
European users feel uneasy when transmitting their personal data over the internet, but only a 
minority of users said they used tools and technologies that increased data security.146

EN 21   EN 
In this context, one issue of major concern is the application of the Directive to online social 
network services (SNS). While the social network providers are controllers (since they 
determine the purposes and the means of processing personal information on their online 
communication platforms) the situation is less clear as regards the users of such platforms. 
The Directive does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the 
context of a purely personal or household activity. However, the role of the users may go 
beyond such context. Personal data are often retained and disclosed without the person 
concerning being informed and/or having given his/her consent on this.  
 
ECJ case law147 - referring to the "correspondence and the holding of records of addresses"148 
– has clarified the scope of this exemption. The court ruled that the exemption does not apply 
"with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those 
data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people". This means that users of social 
networks, disclosing personal data of other individuals, act as controllers and therefore cannot 
rely on the complete exemption from the scope of the Directive, even if the processing relates 
to purely non-economic, charitable and religious purposes. On the other hand, the Court 
clarified that the information appearing on a computer in a third country does not constitute a 
transfer of data by the users themselves, and also, that Member States are not prevented from 
extending the scope of their national law to areas not included in the scope of the Directive.149  
 
In practice, in most Member States the Data Protection Authorities focus on the responsibility 
of the service providers, without dealing with the question of whether users of such sites, who 
make personal data available to others, become subject to the law as controllers. In France, 
the Data Protection Authority excludes bloggers from the notification requirement and 
advises internet users who create a personal website for a circle of family or friends to impose 
access restrictions, to inform the individuals concerned, to disseminate the data to third parties 
only within the context of private activities, to give the data subject the opportunity to object 
to it and to ensure a proportional retention period. By contrast, in the UK, the Data Protection 
Authority has not even addressed the responsibilities of the SNS providers and has restricted 
itself entirely to issuing guidance to individual users, without addressing the issues that arise 
on the processing of information about other individuals.  
 
In view of these serious discrepancies between the Member States, the Article 29 Working 
Party issued, in June 2009, an opinion on social networking150. It clarified that the "household 
exemption" applies to users who operate within a purely personal sphere, contacting people as 
part of the management of their personal, family or household affairs. The opinion advocates 
robust security and privacy-friendly default settings and focuses on the obligations of

providers in its recommendations, including the obligation to inform data subjects on the 
different purposes for which they process personal data, and to take particular care with 
regard to the processing of the personal data of minors. It recommends that information on 
other individuals should only be uploaded by a SNS user with that individual's consent.  
 
10.2.2. Freedom of expression 
According to the Directive, should it be necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the 
rules governing freedom of expression, Member States shall provide for exemptions or 
derogations in the national laws for the processing of personal data for solely journalistic 
purposes, artistic or literary expression (Article 9). However, the Directive does not provide 
guidance on what is "necessary" in order to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules 
governing freedom of expression. As regards this exemption, also, the ECJ held that 
processing of personal data must be considered as "solely for journalistic purposes" if the sole 
object of those activities is the disclosure of information, opinions or ideas to the public, and 
that also personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has 
already been published in the media, fall within the scope of application of the Directive.151 In 
its case law, the ECJ stressed the margin for manoeuvre of Member States to determine how, 
in any particular case, a fair balance between freedom of expression and privacy should be 
achieved, provided that the right to freedom of expression and freedom to receive and impart 
information is taken into account, and that any such national decision would have to be 
proportionate in relation to those rights.152  
 
In practice, this provision is applied quite differently in the Member States. The need to 
extend the exception to everyone and not just to journalists, artists or writers is recognised 
particularly clearly by Denmark and Sweden, where the data protection law does not apply to 
the extent of violating the freedom of expression. On the other hand, Luxembourg's law 
contains the caveat that "without prejudice to the rules in the legislation on mass 
communication media", thus focussing on the mass media rather than on non-journalists. It 
provides specific rules on informing the data subject, on the right of access, on transfers to 
third countries and – to the extent that they relate to matters "manifestly made public by the 
data subject" – on the processing of sensitive data. Italian law provides that data on private 
matters may only be reported if there is a "substantial public interest", unless the data subject 
has made the data public, or if their publication is justified in view of the public conduct of 
the data subject.  
 
Austrian law focuses on whether it is "necessary to fulfil the information-providing task of 
media companies, media service providers and their employees". Spanish law does not refer 
to freedom of expression, but contains certain provisions relaxing its rules with regard to the 
processing of data derived from "publicly accessible sources". In France, there are a number

EN 23   EN 
of exemptions for the media and for literary or artistic expression, explicitly stressing that 
these exemptions are without prejudice to the rules in civil and criminal law of defamation. In 
Germany, the "media privilege" does not exempt the media from the data protection 
requirements, but recognises that the interests of data subjects and controllers must be 
balanced differently in this context. In other Member States (e.g. Belgium, Netherlands, 
Portugal), the exemptions relate to a more limited range of provisions. Belgian law spells out 
that issues such as the protection of sources, or whether the normal rules would hamper the 
collection of information, should be taken into account. The UK and the Irish law impose the 
requirement that the controller "reasonably believes" that the processing is "in the public 
interest", thus leaving, in practice, the emphasis on self-regulatory control of the press. In 
Greece, the law only grants an exemption from the obligation to inform data subjects, and 
then only if the data subjects are "public figures". Apart from these widely different 
approaches in national legislation, in several Member States "non-professionals" such as SNS 
users and "bloggers" are not covered by exemptions in relation to freedom of expression, 
despite the fact that their "user-generated" information will, to a significant extent, provide 
information to the public.  
 
As regards the disclosure of information to the public or to third parties, the ECJ153 has made 
it clear that no automatic priority can be conferred to the objective of transparency over the 
right of personal data, and that the disclosure of documents involving personal data would 
require demonstrating the necessity for their disclosure on compelling legitimate grounds. 
 
Both the "household exemptions" and exemptions in relation to freedom of expression create 
increasing uncertainty in particular as regards the processing of data by users of social 
networks. The limitations of "purely personal or household activities" and the application of 
data protection rules for disclosing to the public information, opinions or ideas, in relation to 
the freedom of expression should be clarified. 
 
10.3. The applicable law - Article 4 
The Commission’s first report on the implementation of the Data Protection Directive154 in 
2003 already highlighted the fact that the provisions on applicable law were “deficient in 
several cases, with the result that the kind of conflicts of law Article 4 seeks to avoid could 
arise”. The situation has not improved since then, as a result of which it is not always clear to 
data controllers and data protection supervisory authorities which law is applicable where data 
processing in several Member States is involved.

(95/46/EC) - COM(2003)265. 
 
EN 24   EN 
The linking of the applicable law to any establishment of the controller leads to the 
consequence that the same controller has to comply with different national laws which apply 
for each of its establishments. This is particularly the case for data controllers established in 
several Member States and obliged to comply with the – sometimes divergent – requirements 
and practices in each of these Member States. Moreover, the divergence in the 
implementation of the Directive by Member States creates legal uncertainty as to which legal 
obligations apply. This is not only relevant for data controllers, but also for data subjects, 
creating the risk of distorting the equivalent level of protection that the Directive is supposed 
to achieve and ensure. This may lead to situations of different levels of protection, e.g. when 
Member States follow different interpretations of the "household exemption", or of the 
concept of freedom of expression. Data Protection Authorities frequently provide guidance to 
controllers on how to comply with their law on the internet, but rarely on the question of 
when their law applies to these activities. Generally, they do not seek to apply their national 
laws to processing operations of controllers established in other Member States (see point 
2.12.6).  
 
Uncertainties exist also on the issue as to which national law applies to the processing 
activities of controllers located outside the EU, in particular when the data controller is not 
established in the EU but provides its services to EU residents in several Member States. The 
application of the Directives for such controllers is linked to the "use of equipment, automated 
or otherwise, situated on the territory" of the Member State, unless used for purposes of 
transit. However, already the notion of "equipment" itself is not clear and widely interpreted 
in the sense of "means". This is in particular relevant given the growing complexity due to 
globalisation and technological developments: data controllers increasingly operate in several 
Member States and jurisdictions, providing services and assistance around the clock. The 
internet makes it much easier for data controllers established outside the EU to provide 
services from a distance and to process personal data in the online environment, and it is often 
difficult to determine the location of personal data and of equipment used at any given time 
(e.g., in “cloud computing” applications and services). Whereas, for example, in most 
Member States, the Data Protection Authorities regard the use of "cookies" – in line with the 
opinion of the Article 29 Working Party155 - as sufficient to bring the processing of data by a 
non-EU controller within the scope of their laws, investigating violations on the internet and 
enforcement of the data protection rules becomes difficult where servers are located outside 
the EU. In some Member States (e.g. in France), the views of national courts and Data 
Protection Authorities differ from each other. The "transit" criterion is applied by several 
Member States (including Belgium, Finland, Ireland, UK) only to the Member State in 
question, or without clarifying whether this means transit through their territory or transit 
through the EU (e.g. Greece, Netherlands and Spain).  
 
Divergent approaches exist also in relation to the obligation to appoint a representative for a 
non-EU based controller. In many Member States it is not known how many controllers not 
established on EU territory and making use of equipment situated on their territory have 
designated a representative, as required by Article 4(2) of the Directive. Thus this obligation 
                                                 
155  Opinion 1/2008, 4.8.2008 (WP 148). 
 
EN 25   EN 
to designate a representative is hardly enforced in practice. This situation creates the serious 
risk of depriving individuals of the protection to which they are entitled under the EU Charter 
of Fundamental Rights and EU data protection legislation.  
 
In December 2010, the Article 29 Working Party issued an opinion156 aimed at clarifying the 
concept of applicable law. It notes, inter alia, that several Member States' laws could become 
applicable when establishments of the same controller are located in several Member States. 
The "use of equipment" provision should apply in those cases where there is no establishment 
on EU territory, or where the processing is not carried out in the context of such 
establishment. The opinion recommends simplifying the rules for determining applicable law, 
and applying the 'country of origin principle' on the basis of comprehensive harmonisation of 
national legislation, so that the same law applies to all establishments of the controller, 
regardless of the location of the establishments. Where the controller is established outside the 
EU, it recommends, inter alia, to developing 'targeting criteria' when processing is targeted at 
individuals in the EU, and to apply the equipment criterion in a limited form. 
 
Uncertainties and different approaches as regards applicable law demonstrate the need for a 
revision of the provisions on applicable law, in order to improve legal certainty and ultimately 
provide for the same degree of protection of EU data subjects, regardless of the geographic 
location of the data controller. 
 
10.4. Data Protection Principles - Article 6 
The data protection principles are in general considered, both by Member States and 
stakeholders, as being sound and valid. However, the wording of the purpose-limitation 
principle leaves it open to divergent application, ranging from "reasonable expectations" of 
the data subject, to "fairness" or the application of various "balance tests". In some countries, 
the principle is subject to exemptions, particularly for the public sector. In others, purposes 
are sometimes defined in excessively broad terms. The rules concerning the change of 
purpose for the processing of non-sensitive personal data without the consent of the data 
subject, including for research and statistical purposes, vary considerably, as they do as 
regards the requirement of safeguards. Some Member States do not provide any safeguards, 
and others only minimal, insufficient safeguards.  
Also, the vague terminology that personal data must be "not excessive" in relation to the 
purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed, leaves room for divergent 
interpretations and does not guarantee data minimisation, i.e. limiting the extent of 
processing to the minimum necessary in relation to its purposes. This is relevant e.g. in view 
of the collection and storage period for personal data or of privacy-friendly default settings 
which could enhance data protection. Currently, default settings are often overly complex and 
not user friendly; also, the method of changing them can be unclear or imprecise.

While the Directive requires that personal data be processed "fairly" and provides for certain 
information requirements, it does not explicitly express the "principle of transparency" in the 
sense that the data must be processed in a manner that is transparent to the data subject. The 
specific inclusion of such a principle would emphasise that transparency is a fundamental 
condition for enabling individuals to exercise control over their own data and to ensure 
effective protection of their personal data, which could serve as a basis for improved 
information requirements (see section 2.7.).  
 
Another issue is the need to clarify the role of data controllers in ensuring compliance with 
these principles, as required by Article 6(2) of the Directive. The Working Party concluded, in 
its opinion of 13 July 2010 on the principle of accountability157, that there is a need to 
strengthen this concept by requiring data controllers to implement appropriate and effective 
measures to ensure that the principles and obligations of the Directive are complied with, and 
demonstrate this to the Data Protection Authorities upon request. Such a principle on the 
comprehensive responsibility of data controllers would need to be clarified and accompanied 
by the elaboration of detailed provisions, specifying the concepts of controllers and 
processors. 
 
While the key data protection principles have proven to still be valid and sound, the principles 
of data minimisation, transparency should be added, as well as the principle of comprehensive 
responsibility of the data controller to ensure and demonstrate compliance with data 
protection rules. Clarification is also needed particularly on the conditions for the change of 
purpose of the processing of personal data, which are collected for another purpose, and on 
the processing of personal data for statistical and research purposes. 
 
10.5. Lawfulness of processing - Article 7 
In several Member States the criteria set out in Article 7(a) to (f) of the Directive are 
transposed as alternative grounds for lawful processing on equal footing (e.g. in Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden). In Austria, Germany 
and Spain, consent and processing based on a law or to fulfil a legal obligation are given 
primary status, the other criteria being seen as exceptions. In other countries (including the 
Czech Republic, France, Greece and Portugal) processing on the basis of consent is the sole 
primary criterion. In Italy this is the case only for the private sector.  
As regards processing on the basis of consent, the legitimacy of processing depends on the 
concept of "consent", which is understood and applied differently from Member State to 
Member State (see point 2.1.3). Apart from that, uncertainties arise as to how far data 
                                                 
157  Opinion 3/2010, 13.7.2010 (WP 173). 
 
EN 27   EN 
processing in the public sector and other specific sectors, such as employment, may rely on 
the consent of the data subject. 
In relation to processing on the basis of a legal obligation, the ECJ158 and the European Court 
of Human Rights159 clarified the issue of whether such legal obligation might be justified by 
reasons of substantial public interest such as those laid down in Article 8 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and the requirement of necessity and proportionality for this 
purpose. However, different standards in the quality of laws cause problems particularly in 
the cross-border context, both in the private and public sector. This may lead to the situation 
that the Member State in which the data are further processed does not meet the requirements 
of the law of the Member State in which the data are collected. Another uncertainty is whether 
the legal obligation or the public interest as a legal basis for processing is to be determined by 
the national law to which the controller is subject, or by the national law of any EU Member 
State, which might then require the data collection and disclosure by a controller residing in 
another Member State. As regards a third country requesting the transfer of data collected in a 
Member State, the Article 29 Working Party indicated that an obligation imposed by a third 
country's legal statute or regulation requiring a controller in a Member State to undergo 
processing activities cannot qualify as a legal obligation by virtue of which data processing in 
the EU would be made legitimate160.  
 
The implementation of the "balance of interest" criterion (Article 7(f)) differs substantially 
between Member States. In the UK it is largely left to controllers to conduct the assessment 
and to determine whether they can process personal data on this basis. In the Netherlands, the 
explanatory memorandum to the data protection law sets out guidance on what issues should 
be taken into account when applying this criterion. Given its vagueness, several Member 
States (including Belgium, Ireland and UK) have envisaged issuing further rules for the 
application of this criterion, but have not yet adopted such rules. DPAs have provided 
guidance in their opinions interpreting the law. In some countries, it is explicitly indicated that 
the balance test applies only to the private sector (e.g. Germany) or in cases specified by the 
Data Protection Authority (Italy) or on the basis of the permission of the national data 
protection supervisory authority in a specific case (Finland). Other countries (including 
Greece and Spain) impose stricter requirements on processing on the basis of this criterion. 
Thus, by its nature, this criterion gives the Member States latitude to adapt its application to 
specific situations.  
 
In view of divergent approaches in the Member States, the criteria on lawfulness of 
processing on the basis of consent, of a legal obligation and of the 'balance of interest' 
criterion need clarification and specification.

10.6. Sensitive data - Article 8 
The Directive is based on the premise that certain categories of personal data, as distinct from 
all other personal data, require extra protection and may be processed by private and public 
bodies only for specific purposes and under special conditions. Therefore, the Directive 
prohibits, as a general rule, the processing of exhaustively listed special categories of data, the 
so-called 'sensitive data', i.e. data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious 
or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning 
health or sex life, unless under certain conditions and safeguards. Without qualifying them as 
such special categories of data, the Directive sets out that for data relating to offences, 
criminal convictions or security measures, Member States may provide specific safeguards. 
When implementing this provision, some Member States go beyond the categories of 
"sensitive data" set out in the Directive and have added genetic data (e.g. Bulgaria, the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal) and biometric data (e.g. the Czech Republic, 
Slovenia and Estonia). Portugal regards "private life" as sensitive data, Poland "party 
membership" (in addition to trade-union membership) and "addictions". Some Member States 
have also included data from the judiciary in their catalogue of special categories of personal 
data, for example information about previous convictions or criminal behaviour (e.g. Cyprus, 
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland). On the other hand, 
some national laws do not include information on ethnic origin, political opinions or 
philosophical beliefs. Belgium provides a specific provision for health data in line with the 
Directive.  
 
Genetic data are not expressly mentioned by the Directive in the list of 'sensitive data'. 
However scientific progress made over recent years in the field of genetic research has given 
rise to new data protection issues in relation to genetic tests and more generally to the 
processing of genetic data. Genetic data show characteristics which make them unique. The 
judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, in S and Marper v United Kingdom161, 
stated that there could be little, if anything, more private to the individual than the knowledge 
of his genetic make-up162. The fact that some Member States have listed genetic data as 
‘sensitive data’ in their data protection law with associated restrictions and safeguards, 
whereas in most Member States the issue of the processing of genetic data is not regulated as 
such, leads to the consequence that an individual’s fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA 
profiles may be processed for different purposes from one Member State to another, with 
different data protection rules and standards applying.  
Beyond sensitive data, France considers specific categories of treatments as “risky”. Such 
“risky treatments” include for instance genetic data, biometric data and information about 
criminal records. Processing such data is not prohibited as such but is subject to prior 
authorisation from the data protection supervisory authority. 
                                                 
161  S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 4 December 2008, applications nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04. 
162   For a more detailed analysis, see the Article 29 Working Party “Working Document on Genetic Data” (WP 91). 
 
EN 29   EN 
Differences in the interpretation of the categories in the Directive may also be observed: e.g. 
"health data" may range from information about a simple cold to information about illnesses 
or disabilities. Furthermore, the term "racial origin" (in addition to "ethnic origin") is often 
differently understood. Photos and images of persons, such as those published on the Internet 
or taken by traffic monitoring or other surveillance cameras, are especially problematic, since 
they can reveal information about an individual's ethnic origin or health status. Finally, there 
are differences in applying certain categories of sensitive data in Member States, because the 
degree of sensitivity may be seen in one Member State differently than in another Member 
State, e.g. with regard to the category “trade-union membership”. 
 
As regards the exceptions from the general prohibition of processing 'sensitive data', even 
less harmonisation than for the categories of 'sensitive data' has been achieved. Member 
States have used their discretion in a different fashion with the result of significant differences 
in the implementation of Article 8 (2) – (5). Some Member States impose additional 
requirements for the processing of sensitive data. The Netherlands provides specific 
exemptions for each category of sensitive data. The UK provides specific exemptions and 
conditions for processing genetic data. France allows processing under additional conditions, 
if justified by the purpose of the processing. For the exception based on explicit consent, 
about half of the Member States (including Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, 
Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain) require, as an additional condition, 
that the consent is given in writing. Some Member States stress, in addition to their general 
rules on consent, that the consent for processing sensitive data must not be obtained illegally 
or contrary to accepted moral values (Cyprus, Greece). Other Member States, such as Italy 
and Sweden, do not accept consent as a legitimate basis for processing sensitive data. 
The provision on the processing of sensitive data for specified health-related purposes has 
been implemented by most Member States; in some with corresponding provisions, in others 
with either more stringent or less stringent conditions. For example, in Cyprus and Denmark 
this exception is restricted to health professionals only, whereas in the Czech Republic and in 
Slovakia the exception is extended also to health insurance. In the other Member States, 
which do not recognise such extension to insurance, processing for the purpose of health 
insurance contracts is normally based on the exception of explicit consent; this leads, for 
example, to the use of blanket declarations by insurance companies, which might be doubtful 
both as regards "informed" and "free" consent. DPAs noted the problems in national data 
protection with regard to the term "health professionals". In practice health data are processed 
for various purposes and it is often not clear who belongs to the category of health 
professionals or the group of persons obliged to comparable secrecy obligations. Nor are there 
currently explicit grounds under Article 8 of the Directive justifying the processing of 
sensitive personal data in case of injuries, when health data are transmitted by non-medical 
personnel, e.g. at schools. 
 
The possibility for Member States to add further exemptions for reasons of substantial public 
interest has led to a broad range of exceptions allowing for the processing of sensitive data for 
different purposes. These purposes are mostly related to public security (e.g. in Germany, 
Spain, UK), social security and welfare (e.g. Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, Spain), 
research and statistics (e.g. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Malta, 
Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden), journalistic and artistic purposes (e.g. Belgium, Spain, 
 
EN 30   EN 
UK), the administration of justice (e.g. Ireland, UK), the functioning of government (Ireland), 
protection of public health and fiscal control (Spain) and obligations under international law 
(Netherlands). Some national laws refer to regulations made for reasons of "substantial public 
interest" (Ireland) or, for certain categories of data, to the "general interest" (Spain). However, 
in the national laws of several Member States provisions on suitable safeguards are missing. 
Consequently, the Article 29 Working Party noted a need to formulate more precisely the 
exception for the processing of sensitive data “for reasons of substantial public interest”.  
 
The provision on data relating to offences, criminal convictions or security measures is also 
transposed in various ways, partly by including it in the categories of "sensitive data" (e.g. 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain) or by a special legal 
framework (e.g. Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg), but in many Member 
States suitable safeguards are not provided. As far as these categories are included in the 
definition of sensitive data, this has consequences such as that explicit consent may serve as a 
legitimate basis for data processing.  
 
In many cases the provision on the notification of derogations from Article 8(1) of the 
Directive to the Commission has not been transposed. This is demonstrated by the fact that, 
for example, in 2009 the Commission received notifications of derogations only from four 
Member States (Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, UK). As in practice the obligation to notify 
is not always met by Member States it is difficult for the Commission to provide an EU-wide 
overview of those derogations. 
 
Only some Member States (including Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, 
Netherlands, Romania, and Sweden) have determined the conditions under which the 
national identity number can be transposed, with different basic approaches to the use of this 
identifier, ranging from a widespread exchange between public authorities to more restricted 
use. Some countries allow the use of such a number in the private sector, whereas others are 
restrictive in this regard.  
 
Divergent approaches about what categories of data are considered as being "sensitive data" 
and under what conditions such data may be processed call for an examination of the concept 
of sensitive data, including the categories and their possible extension e.g. on genetic data and 
for further harmonising the conditions under which such data may, exceptionally, be 
processed.  
 
10.7. Information to data subjects - Articles 10 and 11 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Directive oblige the controller or his representative to inform the 
data subject as to the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and to provide 
any further information "in so far as such further information is necessary". Despite the 
 
EN 31   EN 
examples of such information listed in those provisions, this open wording leads to 
uncertainties whether such information might or might not be necessary in a specific situation. 
Moreover, the application of the information requirement itself is not always ensured on in 
practice. For example, a survey conducted by the Commission among Data Protection 
Authorities and Member States in the case of hotel registrations revealed that not in all 
Member States national law obliges hotels to inform travellers about the purposes of the 
processing of their personal data when completing hotel registration forms. Whereas such an 
obligation exists e.g. in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
Luxembourg, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, in other 
Member States the hotels are not required to provide such information (e.g. in Austria, 
Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Spain). Some Member States argued that the 
information requirement is fulfilled by expressly laying down in the law the purposes of the 
registration as well as other information.163  
 
Despite being particularly relevant for individuals for exercising their rights, Articles 10 and 
11 currently do not require informing the data subject of the competent Data Protection 
Authority and its contact details nor do these provisions specify how long the data will be 
retained. Moreover, the information provided by the controller is often not easily accessible 
and difficult to understand. Especially in the online environment, quite often privacy notices 
are unclear, difficult to access, non-transparent164 and not always in full compliance with 
existing rules. A case where this might be so is online behavioural advertising, where both the 
proliferation of actors involved in the provision of behavioural advertising and the 
technological complexity of the practice make it difficult for an individual to know and 
understand if personal data are being collected, by whom, and for what purpose.  
 
Despite children deserving specific protection, as they may be less aware of risks, 
consequences, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data165, there are 
no specific requirements in the Directive. The lack of clear and understandable information of 
the data subjects also affects the validity of consent, which requires, as a fundamental 
condition, "informed consent" (see point 2.1.3 on the concept of consent). 
Data breaches, in particular of large companies’ customer databases, are increasing. Security 
failures may lead to harmful consequences for individuals, ranging from undesired spam to 
                                                 
163  Despite the Commission's request, the Article 29 Working Party did not include this issue in its Working 
Programme and thus has not provided an opinion so far. 
164 A Eurobarometer survey carried out in 2009 showed that about half of the respondents considered 
privacy notices in websites 'very' or 'quite unclear' (see Flash Eurobarometer No 282 :  
http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_282_en.pdf). 
165 See the Safer Internet for Children qualitative study concerning 9-10 year old and 12-14 year old 
children, which showed that children tend to underestimate risks linked to the use of Internet and 
minimise the consequences of their risky behaviour (available at:  
http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/sip/surveys/qualitative/index_en.htm). 
 
EN 32   EN 
identity theft166. The recent revision of the e-Privacy Directive167 introduced a mandatory 
personal data breach notification, which covers, however, only the electronic communications 
sector. Given that risks of data breaches also exist in other sectors (e.g. the financial sector), 
the consultation carried out by the Commission in 2010-2011 confirmed the need to extend 
the information of data subjects to a general obligation of the controller to inform Data 
Protection Authorities and, in defined circumstances, also of data subjects when their data are 
accidentally or unlawfully destroyed, lost, altered, accessed by or disclosed to unauthorised 
persons.  
 
 
 
 
To ensure that individuals are well informed in a transparent way, data controllers should be 
obliged to inform data subjects about how and by whom their data are collected and 
processed, for what reasons, for how long and what their rights are if they want to access, 
rectify or delete their data. This information should be provided in an easily accessible and 
understandable way, using clear and plain language. Data controllers should be obliged to 
notify data breaches to Data Protection Authorities and, under defined circumstances, also to 
data subjects.  
 
10.8. Rights of the data subjects - Article 12  
The Directive provides for a set of rights for individuals. These include individuals' rights vis-
à-vis those processing their personal data such as the right to access, rectify, block and delete 
their own data. These rights are, however, expressed in general terms and the way they can 
actually be exercised is not clearly specified. Nor does the Directive impose any deadlines for 
responding to data subjects’ requests or any indication of the level of fees for exercising the 
rights to rectification, erasure and blocking; the condition "without excessive delay or 
expense" applies only to the right of access. 
 
All Member States guarantee the right of the data subject to access his/her own data, 
although also in that respect there are differences in the implementation in national law. In 
some countries (e.g. Greece, Spain and Sweden) the controllers are required to inform the data 
subject, on request, about the source of the data, the processor or of any developments in 
                                                 
166 Interesting figures on recent data breaches and losses can be found at: http://datalossdb.org (data not 
verified).

Directive 2009/136/EC, OJ L 337, 18.12.2009, p. 11. 
 
EN 33   EN 
processing since the last access request. In the Netherlands the law stipulates that the 
controller must contact other individuals if their data are involved and decide, in the light of 
the response, whether to disclose this data. UK follows a similar approach, but with an 
exemption concerning information given in confidence to the controller for certain purposes, 
including employment. In Germany the right of access is extended to data held in 
unstructured files, if the data controller, e.g. a credit reference agency, processes the data 
professionally for the purpose of providing the data to others. Other countries provide specific 
rules relating to such purposes. Austrian law provides that, on the data subject's request, the 
data may not be deleted for a period of four months. ECJ case law clarified that the Directive 
requires Member States to ensure the right of access, not only in respect of the present, but 
also in respect of the past, and to provide for access to that information on the basis of a fair 
balance between the interests of the data subject and the burden for the controller.168  
 
All Member States guarantee in their laws the right of data subjects to obtain rectification of 
personal data relating to them, but also with some differences. In Greece, this right extends to 
all contested processing, whereas in other Member States this is linked to incomplete or 
incorrect data. The laws in Austria and Germany provide that documents retained for 
historical purposes need not be rectified, but the data subject has the right to have comments 
added. Austrian law stipulates also that regularly issued compilations, such as address lists, 
should be corrected in the subsequent regular issue.  
 
The right to request the deletion of data is provided by the Directive, but in practice it is 
difficult for an individual to enforce this right vis-à-vis the data controller. Recent reported 
cases about people seeking to have their data deleted from a social network are a telling 
example of the practical difficulty to exercise this right especially in the online 
environment169.  
 
It is also not always clear who owns the personal data supplied by a user to a service provider. 
The Directive provides no explicit right for the individual to withdraw his/her own personal 
data (e.g. his/her photos or a list of friends) from an online-service, so that the individual may 
transfer data to another application or service.  
 
The way in which these rights can be exercised differs from country to country, so that 
exercising them is actually easier in some Member States than in others. All Member States 
except Spain give data subjects the right to obtain an actual copy of the data. In some Member 
States (e.g. Austria, Finland, UK) the law expressly provides that, if the data subject agrees, 
the controller may, as an alternative, offer access on its premises or online rather than by hard

copy. In other Member States this alternative is at the discretion of the controllers, at least 
when a copy in permanent form is not feasible or would involve a disproportionate effort (e.g. 
Ireland). In France, access to data on criminal convictions, "penalty points" on a driving 
licence and certain medical data is restricted to the inspection of the data, without providing 
the right to obtain a hard copy. In some Member States individuals have to pay a fee to access 
their data, while in others it is free of charge170. Some Member States impose a deadline on 
data controllers to respond to access requests, while others do not.  
 
Clarification and enhancement of the individual's control over his or her "own data" is needed, 
including the right to have the data deleted or to retrieve data from online service providers. 
Also, the conditions and modalities for the actual exercise of the rights of access, rectification 
and deletion of data need to be improved and harmonised, taking into account electronic 
means which facilitate access to their data and the exercise of these rights.  
  
10.9. Notification of processing and Data Protection Officers - Article 18  
10.9.1. Notification 
Article 18 of the Directive imposes a general notification requirement, but leaves 
considerable room for manoeuvre to Member States to determine exemptions from and 
simplifications of notification requirements and the procedures to be followed. Accordingly, 
Member States adopt very different approaches. Some national laws (e.g. Bulgaria, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Spain, Romania, and UK) require all 
controllers to notify. In several Member States the controllers are required to notify when the 
processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. France, Malta, Netherlands, and Sweden). 
Other national laws require hardly any controllers to notify, except in limited circumstances 
on the basis of a positive list (e.g. Austria, Finland).  
 
Moreover, the details and the use of the information provided by the notifications vary from 
Member State to Member State. The most frequent use of notifications is for inspections and 
audits, and for contacting the controllers. Most DPAs consider the purposes of the processing 
and data categories to be the most useful information, whereas the description of security 
procedures is considered as less useful for their purposes. Some DPAs use the notifications 
for prior checking; some only use it to contact organisations in cases of a complaint, for 
enforcement purposes.  
 
In several Member States, Data Protection Authorities collect notification fees, whereas 
others do not. The fees collected for a single notification range from about 23 EUR to about 
599 EUR. In some Member States the fee varies depending on: whether the data controller is 
a natural or legal person; if processing is in the public or private sector; the numbers of staff 
                                                 
170  EB 2011. 
 
EN 35   EN 
and turnover; or by the method of notification, i.e. paper or online (e.g. Belgium). Some 
Member States charge a fee for amendments to the notification. In other Member States the 
fees are a one-off charge or an annual charge. Among those DPAs who collect fees, most 
receive income to their budget; this ranges from just over 1.2 % of their budget up to 100%, 
i.e. providing their complete budget (UK DPA). In few Member States the fees are paid into 
general revenue and do not benefit the DPA's budget.  
 
There is general consensus amongst data controllers that the current general obligation to 
notify all data processing operations to the Data Protection Authorities is a rather 
cumbersome obligation which does not provide, in itself, any real added value for the 
protection of individuals' personal data, but rather creates an additional administrative and 
financial burden. This is particularly the case, as a consequence of the rules on the applicable 
law, where a controller is established in several Member States and has to comply with 
divergent notification systems.  
 
According to the Article 29 Working Party's Advice paper on notification, a public register 
held by a DPA is no longer the best and most appropriate way for individuals to understand 
what an organisation is doing with their personal data, and who to contact when things go 
wrong. 
 
10.9.2. Data Protection Officers 
Most Member States made use of the possibility to exempt from the notification requirement 
in case that the controller ensures internal control of data processing operations by appointing 
a Data Protection Officer (DPO). However, only the national laws of about one third of the 
Member States (including France, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, 
Malta, Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia) contain specific provisions on the expertise or the 
independence of the DPO regarding the exercise of his/her functions.  
While the appointment of a DPO is optional for the controller in other Member States, in 
Germany the appointment of a DPO is mandatory: for the public sector and – with a specified 
threshold of, in principle, ten employees permanently employed in the automatic processing – 
for the private sector. This does not necessarily lead to the recruitment of additional staff; 
often the assignment is given as an additional task to an existing staff member where the DPO 
function does not require a full-time, dedicated staff member. Other controllers outsource this 
task to external DPOs which provide services to various clients.  
Existing studies point to the fact that larger corporations, especially multinationals, usually 
already have appointed data protection officers. The same is true for many public data 
controllers in a number of Member States. The Article 29 Working Party noted that the 
successful experience of the mandatory introduction of Data Protection Officers in Germany 
abolished not only the centralised system of notification and public register, but contributed 
 
EN 36   EN 
also to the development of sector-specific best practices in data processing and protection.171 
This has been confirmed by stakeholders who expressed strong support for such concept, seen 
as a key element to demonstrate "accountability". 
 
Given the different approaches of Member States to the notification requirements and on the 
exemptions there from, and the administrative burden for operators in the internal market to 
comply with different rules and concepts, a revision of the current notification system is 
needed.  Harmonised conditions and standards are also needed for Data Protection Officers. 
 
10.10.Remedies and Sanctions - Articles 22 and 24 
10.10.1. Remedies 
All Member States guarantee, as a fundamental principle of the rule of law, the right to seek 
redress and corrective action through the courts. Data subjects are therefore entitled by 
ordinary administrative or civil law to go to court. In some Member States, data protection 
law either creates a special tort, or adds such a special right to the general law. The forum and 
the procedures are also determined by the ordinary court procedural law, However, under the 
applicable rules in the Directive, the courts may have to apply the substantial law of the 
country in which the controller is located.  
 
The substantial law differs to a certain extent from Member State to Member State, but in 
principle, the applicable administrative or civil law provides, in line with the Directive, that 
the controller is liable for compensation, unless he/she can prove that he/she is not 
responsible for the event causing the damage. In Ireland, under certain conditions, there is 
some lessening of the controller's burden of proof in view of alleged inaccuracy. UK law is 
more restrictive concerning non-material damage, for which compensation can only be 
awarded if material damage has also been proved. Belgium, Italy and Greece give data 
subjects the option of settling disputes either through the courts or by lodging a complaint to 
the Data Protection Authority in a quasi-judicial procedure.  
 
Despite the fact that many cases where an individual is affected by an infringement of data 
protection rules also affect a considerable number of other individuals in a similar situation, in 
many Member States judicial remedies, while available, are very rarely pursued in practice. 
This seems to be related to a general reluctance to bring an action to court, often related to the 
lack of information and the financial risk for the individual, when he/she is obliged to bear the 
costs of an unsuccessful claim for a judicial remedy, or when the damage is limited, e.g. in the 
case of unsolicited mails. Whereas the Directive spells out that each supervisory authority 
shall hear claims also when lodged by an association representing the individual, such 
                                                 
171  Report on the obligation to notify the national supervisory authorities, the best use of exceptions and 
simplification and the role of data protection officers in the European Union, 18.1.2005 (WP 106). 
 
EN 37   EN 
possibility that associations represent data subjects in court cases is not provided by the 
Directive. On the other hand, stakeholders expressed reluctance as regards a 'class action' 
style procedure, fearing that this would increase the cost of services. 
 
10.10.2. Sanctions 
The Directive obliges Member States to "lay down the sanctions to be imposed in case of 
infringement of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive", but does not detail the 
categories of sanctions or whether and, if so, what sanctions could be imposed by Data 
Protection Authorities or by other authorities or by the courts. Accordingly, the 
implementation of this general provision by the individual Member States has given rise to 
significant variations. In most Member States, both the DPAs and the judicial authorities have 
the power to impose sanctions, in others the sanctioning power is only for judicial authorities. 
Administrative fines are imposed by the DPAs in most Member States, but not in all (e.g. not 
in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Lithuania, Hungary and UK). Criminal sanctions have been 
imposed by judicial authorities in most Member States, but not in e.g. Bulgaria, the Czech 
Republic, Spain and Latvia. Hungary does not provide for administrative or criminal 
sanctions for the violation of data protection rules at all, but merely establishes liability under 
civil law. Slovakia in addition to administrative fines introduced disciplinary fines which may 
be imposed by the DPA. 
The degree of precision of the infringements which are subject to administrative sanctions 
diverges considerably between the countries. Some countries define the infringements in 
general terms, for instance 'processing of personal data in violation of the Data Protection 
Law' (e.g. Lithuania). Others enumerate long and very detailed lists of infringements, such as: 
failure to specify the purpose, means or manner of processing; processing of inaccurate 
personal data; collecting or processing of personal data in a scope or manner which does not 
correspond to the specified purpose; preservation of personal data for a period longer than 
necessary for the purpose of processing; processing of personal data without the necessary 
consent of data subject; failure to provide the data subject with information in the scope or in 
the manner provided by law; refusal to provide the data subject with the requested 
information; failure to adopt or implement measures for ensuring security of personal data 
processing; failure to fulfil the notification obligation (e.g. Czech Republic).  
Administrative fines in most Member States are established by specifying the minimum and 
maximum amount of money, while some others also make a reference to the percentage of 
gross turnover for the latest financial year in case the data controller is a legal entity (e.g. 
France). The upper limits for violating data protection laws range from €290 in Lithuania up 
to €120,000 in Italy, €300,000 in Germany and €601,000 in Spain. Some Member States 
differentiate the fines according to the type of the data controller, distinguishing natural and 
legal persons (e.g. Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Portugal), whether there is a 
repetitiveness of the offence or not (e.g. France, Lithuania), or have specific provisions to take 
into account negligence or intent (e.g. Poland, Portugal). In a few Member States the attempt 
to commit an offence is subject to penalty (e.g. Austria).  
 
 
EN 38   EN 
Criminal sanctions are not imposed in all Member States (e.g. not in Bulgaria, Czech 
Republic, Latvia). In almost two thirds of the Member States detention has been imposed for 
serious violations of the data protection rules. The maximum period for imprisonment ranges 
from 4 months (e.g. Denmark and Portugal), one year (e.g. Austria) and two years (e.g. 
Germany, Sweden) up to three years (Spain and Poland). Several Member States do not 
impose criminal sanctions at all. The amount of criminal fines also differs significantly 
between Member States.  
 
 
 
In a number of Member States the level of fines is seen as too low. Fines are imposed too 
infrequently to have a dissuasive effect, or because supervisory bodies have not developed a 
practice of imposing them. In some countries prosecutions and sanctions for violation of data 
protection law are extremely limited.  
 
In order to facilitate the application of remedies, the right to bring an action in court might be 
extended to civil society associations representing data subjects. There is also the need for 
strengthening the existing provisions on sanctions, including by explicitly obliging the 
Member States to impose criminal sanctions in cases of serious data protection violations. 
 
10.11.Data transfers to third countries – Articles 25 and 26 
10.11.1. Adequacy 
Article 25 provides the principles for the transfer of personal data on the basis of an adequacy 
decision, either on the basis of national law or by the Commission.172 However, the condition 
that the third country must provide an adequate level of protection to the data being 
transferred is implemented by Member States in different ways. Some allow the data 
controller itself to conduct the adequacy check, while others reserve it for national authorities, 
in particular the DPAs. This leads to divergent approaches and uncertainties on the 
interpretation of "adequate level of "protection", and varying interpretations of this concept 
between Member States, the DPAs and data controllers for declaring that the level of 
protection of a third country is adequate for the purposes of transfers to that country.  
As regards the Commission's adequacy decisions, the effect of such unilateral recognition by 
the Commission that a given third country ensures an adequate level of data protection is to 
allow the free flow of personal data from EU Members States to that third country. The 
Commission may unilaterally launch the procedure with a view of assessing a third country's 
data protection legislation. In some cases, the Commission has adopted partial adequacy 
                                                 
172  See CRIDS (University of Namur), Assessment of the application of Article 25 of Directive 95/46, July 
2011. 
 
EN 39   EN 
findings covering not all but only specific transfers of personal data to a particular third 
country.173 
In the course of its adequacy findings the Commission has encountered various failings in the 
data protection system of third countries, for example, failure on the part of public authorities 
to respect data subject's rights to privacy and the lack of independent data protection 
institutions. 
At the same time, adequacy findings constitute a real opportunity for the Commission to 
engage in dialogue with third countries, promoting an EU compatible data protection model. 
Indeed, in today's world, characterised by constant and rapid development of new 
technologies where international data flows take place easily and quickly, traditional 
measures might not ensure sufficient protection of EU individuals.  
Furthermore, the Commission's adequacy decisions are perceived by some third countries as a 
means to promote their strategy for a digital economy and a modern information society. 
These countries consider that adequacy decisions will allow them to become actively involved 
in international flows of personal data and they will thus become internationally recognised as 
offering an adequate infrastructure and adequate means for processing personal data received 
from the rest of the world.  
Nevertheless, current practice has shown its limits. Apart from the fact that adequacy findings 
involve a complex, lengthy and detailed exercise, Commission adequacy decisions are 
accorded a "direct effect" in only a minority of Member States. In most cases there are 
preliminary legislative and administrative formalities before such decisions can take effect. 
Depending on the Member State concerned, Commission decisions must be ratified 
legislatively, notified by the ministry to the national data protection supervisory authority, 
adopted by the supervisory authority, or notified in advance to, and authorised by, the 
supervisory authority.  
 
10.11.2. Standard contractual clauses 
International transfers may also take place to a third country which does not offer an adequate 
level of protection where the controller adduces adequate safeguards, particularly by means of 
standard contractual clauses, which are included in contracts that allow data transfers from a 
data controller established in the EU to data controllers and processors in third countries. The 
Commission standard contractual clauses were updated in February 2010174, to cover 
subsequent sub-processing activities and provide a single contractual framework for all 
processing activities related to a given transfer.  
Contractual clauses are seen as a useful instrument for international transfers involving a 
limited number of organisations or companies. However, these are also implemented 
                                                 
173   See for the Commission decisions on the adequacy of third countries' data protection: 
       http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/thridcountries/

EN 40   EN 
differently. In some Member States, the DPA still needs to authorise the transfer, whereas in 
other Member States such authorisation is not required. 
 
10.11.3. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) 
The use of "Binding Corporate Rules" (BCRs), i.e. internal rules followed by a multinational 
corporation for transfers of personal data between the groups of companies belonging to the 
same multinational corporation, has been developed without being explicitly mentioned by 
the Directive.175 Data Protection Authorities in 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, 
Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, 
Malta, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, UK) and three EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, 
Norway) have agreed on a mutual recognition procedure aimed at speeding up the procedure 
of analysis and approval of BCR so as to ensure that they provide the necessary data 
protection safeguards. This procedure, which has been in place since 2008 and in which one 
of those DPAs acts as lead authority in each case, has accelerated the adoption of BCRs, on 
average, from 18 months previously to less than six months.  
However, the use of BCRs also differs. Apart from the fact that not all DPAs participate in 
this mutual recognition scheme, several Member States still require an authorisation for the 
use of BCRs even though they have been approved by DPAs of other Member States. The 
adoption and authorisation of BCRs therefore remains complex and time-consuming. 
Considerable time is often necessary for the dialogue between the multinationals concerned 
and the lead DPAs, as well as to allow the companies to present modified proposals, since this 
requires the regular involvement of the company's board.  
While welcoming the approach of the BCRs and pointing to its increased significance, 
stakeholders in the private sector consider that the implementation of BCRs remains too 
lengthy, particularly due to the fact that they are a complex instrument which must address 
several issues, and that Data Protection Authorities have often no sufficient resources to 
approve BCRs promptly. This has limited the number of companies using this tool176 and 
discouraged several other companies, potentially keen on using them177. Economic 
stakeholders also expressed uncertainties about the notion of 'group of companies' and the 
lack of the inclusion of processors in the application of BCRs, and stressed the need to lay 
down legal rules on BCRs and to improve and simplify the "mutual recognition procedure". 
Given divergent approaches and complex and lengthy procedures, there is a need to improve 
and streamline the current procedures for international data transfers, including providing a 
                                                 
175   BCRs have been developed as a matter of practice by data protection authorities and by the WP29 on the basis 
of  
    an extensive interpretation of Article 25(2) of the Directive. - See the overview on BCR: 
        http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/binding_rules/index_en.htm. 
176   According to information provided by the WP29, 14 BCRs have been approved by DPAs so far, about 25  
        companies have provided DPAs with a first draft of BCRs and another 26 are being prepared.  
177   According to stakeholders' feedback, only the biggest companies can afford to adopt BCRs, due to the 
complexity 
        of the procedure and the related costs, which are € 20,000 on average but can amount – for very large 
companies 
        with many subsidiaries - to €1 million. 
 
EN 41   EN 
clear legal basis for "Binding Corporate Rules. The adequacy procedure should also be 
clarified, particularly as regards the criteria and requirements for assessing the level of data 
protection in a third country. 
 
10.12.National Data Protection Authorities and enforcement - Article 28 
10.12.1. 'Complete independence' of the National Data Protection Authorities - Article 28(1)  
The requirement of "complete independence" has been clarified in a recent ECJ ruling178, 
which stresses particularly that independence implies a decision-making power independent 
of any direct or indirect external influence on the supervisory authority, precluding not only 
any influence exercised by the supervised bodies, but also any directions or any other external 
influence, whether direct or indirect, which could call into question the performance by those 
authorities of their task. The Court ruled therefore that making a DPA subject to state scrutiny 
is not in compliance with the requirement of "complete independence".  
 
In Greece and Portugal an independent supervisory authority is explicitly established even by 
the Constitution. In other Member States DPAs are provided with a distinct legal personality 
(e.g. Malta, Spain) and by the power to bring an action in the Constitutional Court (e.g. 
Slovenia). In a number of Member States concerns arise as to the effective capability of the 
DPAs to perform their tasks with complete independence. These concerns are partly due to 
the fact that staff are appointed exclusively by the government (e.g. Ireland, Luxembourg, 
UK) or by the Minister of Justice (Denmark, Netherlands), whereas, in contrast, in other 
Member States Data Protection Commissioners are elected by legislative assemblies (e.g. 
Germany,  Slovenia), sometimes pursuant to procedures which require consensus between the 
majority and the opposition (e.g. Greece), or in combined procedures involving executive, 
legislature, judiciary and organised societal groups (e.g. France, Spain, Portugal).  
In some countries the DPA is attached to the Ministry of Justice. In some Member States  
(e.g. Slovenia, Poland) the dismissal of Data Protection Commissioners has to follow the 
same procedures as their appointment, and only in specified cases. In other countries, 
government can directly remove them from office (e.g. Ireland).  
 
Understaffing and lack of financial resources also pose problems in several Member States, 
restricting DPAs in the proper exercise of their tasks. Despite increases in the staff of most 
DPAs in recent years, the level of resources available to DPAs continues to remain limited in 
the majority of Member States with regard to their needs. In most Member States the DPAs 
receive their financial resources from the State's budget, and often from the budget allocated 
to the Ministry of Justice. In some Member States, these resources are increased through the 
revenues obtained from notifications and/or the financial sanctions imposed as a penalty for 
the infringement of data protection rules (e.g. Luxembourg, Malta). However, in the UK the 
DPA notification fees are the only financial source of the DPA (see section 2.9 on 
                                                 
178    C-518/07, European Commission v. Germany, 9.3.2010. 
 
EN 42   EN 
notifications). In a large number of Member States the lack of resources represents a 
significant challenge to the effectiveness of the national supervisory systems. In several 
Member States, DPAs do not have enough staff to handle all complaints. Furthermore, due to 
this lack of resources, some DPAs cannot regularly attend the meetings of the WP29. 
 
The concept of "complete independence" of Data Protection Authorities needs to be clarified 
on the basis of the recent Court of Justice ruling, including the requirement to provide 
sufficient resources for the effective performance of the tasks of the Data Protection 
Authorities. 
 
10.12.2. Investigative powers - Article 28(3), first indent   
In all Member States the Data Protection Authorities hear and review claims or complaints 
and are charged with investigating possible infringements of the data protection law within 
their jurisdiction. This includes that they are vested with powers to request and access all 
necessary information in relation to processing operations and filing systems and therefore 
usually demand full access to relevant sites and materials. A range of DPAs practice a 
selective approach, i.e. selecting particular issues or sectors for particular attention, because of 
the importance of the processing in the sector concerned, the sensitivity of data, or because of 
the level of complaints received about the sector. In such cases especially, investigations tend 
to be detailed and in-depth, including discussions with the data controllers, but less so with 
the data subjects or their representatives.  
 
In most Member States the DPAs are empowered to search premises without judicial warrant. 
In Belgium, DPA staff has the status of Officers of Judicial Police when carrying out on-site 
investigations, empowering them to demand, inter alia, the disclosure of documents and 
access locations. But in other Member States (e.g. France, Malta, Romania and UK), the DPA 
cannot enter premises without first obtaining a judicial warrant. 
 
In some Member States the investigative powers are not clearly spelt out in the legal text, 
being expressed as duties rather than as an express reference to powers, or without 
clarification of the relationship to other legislation.  
 
10.12.3. Powers of intervention - Article 28(3), second indent 
The DPAs' powers of intervention differ from Member State to Member State. In most 
Member States the DPAs have the power to authorise processing operations likely to present 
specific risks, but not in others (e.g. Cyprus, Latvia, Spain and the UK). Experience shows 
that a major problem with these "prior checks" is that they are very time-consuming and 
demanding on human resources, and that too often they are carried out too late to be of any 
 
EN 43   EN 
benefit in restructuring processing systems fundamentally, focussing instead on the minor 
details of such systems.  
 
In all Member States, the DPAs may issue a warning to or reprimand the controller, and, 
except in Belgium, issue decisions binding upon the controller to suspend data processing 
operations. In most Member States the DPAs are also empowered to order the erasure or 
destruction of data (but not e.g. in Belgium, Germany or the UK). In Germany, the DPA is 
empowered to demand the dismissal of a Data Protection Officer, if he/she does not possess 
the required specialised knowledge and demonstrate the necessary responsibility. In several 
Member States the law provides that such binding measures should be preceded by 
recommendations, opinions or warnings (e.g. Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, 
Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia).  
 
In most Member States, the DPA has the power to impose sanctions, which mostly consist of 
imposition of administrative measures and/or financial sanctions/fines, however with 
considerable variation as to what constitutes an infringement and severity of sanctions (see 
section 2.10). Most DPAs report infringements to competent police and judicial authorities; in 
several Member States, such obligation is expressly laid down in data protection law (e.g. 
Cyprus, France, Lithuania, Netherlands and Slovenia). French law provides that the DPA may 
publish its warnings and, in certain situations, the penalties imposed. In several Member 
States the DPAs may refer the matter to national Parliament (including Belgium, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands and Sweden). 
 
In all Member States formal actions and sanctions are, in practice, used as a last resort. In 
general, the DPAs see themselves more as advisors, facilitators and conciliators. In more than 
half of Member States, DPAs have issued guidelines to assist in the proper application of the 
data protection rules, including sector specific guidance. In cases of violations of data 
protection rules, DPAs in general first issue warnings, reminders or recommendations. In 
complex cases, DPAs often try to reach a compromise acceptable to the DPA and the 
controller. Such "soft measures" seem to be more effective where they are backed-up by 
effective enforcement powers available to the DPA in the event of non-compliance with the 
agreed measures.  
    
10.12.4. Power to engage in legal proceedings - Article 28(3), third indent  
In many Member States, national laws provide the immediate right to DPAs to bring an 
action to court. But in some Member States this is limited to the private sector or to specific 
situations. In Sweden, for instance, the right to bring an action in court is limited to the 
administrative courts for applications of the DPA to erase personal data which have been 
processed in an unlawful manner. In other Member States, DPAs have only the power to 
bring violations of the data protection rules to the attention of judicial authorities (e.g. 
Austria, Latvia and Ireland). In Slovenia, the DPA has the right to bring an action before the 
Constitutional Court to assess the constitutionality of legislation. In some Member States, 
 
EN 44   EN 
DPAs have the right to join in court proceedings which are initiated by other parties. In 
practice, also in many Member States, even where the DPAs have the power to engage in 
legal proceedings, the DPAs rarely commenced legal proceedings or intervened in legal 
proceedings on behalf of a data subject. In other Member States, the number of interventions 
ranged from 2 to a maximum of 143 cases per year. 
 
In several Member States, Data Protection Authorities are not endowed with the full range of 
powers to conduct investigations, intervene in data processing operations and engage in legal 
proceedings. The divergence in powers and approaches to enforcement taken by the 
individual DPAs causes problems not only for the data subjects who do not enjoy the same 
level of enforcement in each Member States, but also uncertainties for controllers, particularly 
when operating in several Member States.  
 
10.12.5. Appeals against decisions of supervisory authorities - Article 28(3) 
As regards the right to appeal against decisions of the Data Protection Authorities,  Danish 
law stipulates that no appeals may be brought before any other administrative authority 
against the decisions of the DPA, but does not clarify whether there is a right to go to court 
against those decisions. In Slovenia the law provides that there shall be no appeal against a 
decision or ruling of the DPA, but that an "administrative dispute" shall be permitted. Some 
Member States have no specific provision in their data protection law, but provide a general 
right to judicial review against any act of a public authority, on the basis of general court 
procedural law or, e.g. in Germany, on the basis of the Constitution.  
Competent courts are either the ordinary courts or administrative courts. In some Member 
States the competent court is the Supreme Administrative Court (e.g. Austria, Portugal) or the 
general Court of Appeals (e.g. Greece, Sweden), in France the Conseil d'Etat and in Malta a 
specific Data Protection Appeals Tribunal. In several countries judicial review is limited to 
certain acts of the DPA (e.g. Ireland, Luxembourg, UK), or to the grounds of "illegal conduct" 
of the DPA (Hungary). The competence and procedure of the courts and the conditions for a 
right to appeal follow the general national rules of their judicial systems. Cases in which data 
subjects or data controllers have appealed in courts against decisions taken by the national 
data protection supervisory authority are rather limited.  
 
Nearly all Member States guarantee in their national legislation the right to bring an action to 
court against decisions of the Data Protection Authority, either in data protection law or in 
general laws on judicial review.  
 
10.12.6. Cooperation of Data Protection Authorities - Article 28(6)  
Article 28(6) provides the competence of Data Protection Authorities to exercise their powers 
on the territory of their Member State, whatever national law is applicable, and the duty to 
 
EN 45   EN 
exercise their powers on request of another DPA and to cooperate with each other "to the 
extent necessary for the performance of their duties".  
 
Some Member States have provisions which specifically allow them to act on the request of 
the DPA in another Member State (e.g. Denmark, France, Portugal, UK) or to also exercise, 
on its own territory, its powers in cases where the law of another Member State applies (e.g. 
Denmark, Netherlands, Portugal). Whereas several national laws do not contain any related 
provision, other Member States have transposed in their national law only the mandate to 
cooperate with DPAs in other Member States or generally with "foreign" DPAs (e.g. Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, and Spain).  
 
In practice, DPAs liaise and/or cooperate with authorities of other Member States mainly in 
the context of the Article 29 Working Party or in the mutual recognition procedure for BCRs 
(see point 2.11.3). There has also been separate cooperation as between Nordic countries, as 
well as on the part of Central and Eastern Europe Data Protection Commissioners. Other 
forms of cooperation concern the participation in the Article 31 committee, the Working Party 
on Police and Justice, fora such as the Spring Conference of Data Protection Authorities and 
joint supervision for SIS, Europol, Eurojust, Eurodac and the Customs Information System. 
Some DPAs have designated, within their organisation, a contact point for such cooperation. 
DPAs have also some experience in joint investigations, where each applies its own law in its 
own jurisdiction.  
 
However, the situation is more complex when jurisdiction and applicable law do not 
coincide. This concerns not only the legal aspect in terms of the applicable law to be 
followed, but also procedural aspects as regards the respective roles, responsibilities, powers 
and practices of each DPA involved. Thus, when a controller is established in more than one 
Member State or in other similar situations, the approaches taken by DPAs could considerably 
differ from one Member State to another.  
 
Despite the fact that the Directive creates the duty of mutual cooperation and information 
exchange, there is no cooperation mechanism established by the Directive to provide an 
effective cooperation in such situations. This is amplified by the lack of harmonisation with 
regard to investigation powers and the absence of a legal obligation to reply and to inform of 
the outcome of proceedings, while current cooperation seems to be based on "good will", and 
deadlines are difficult to respect. There is hardly any experience on the application of the 
national law of another Member State; difficulties could arise in enforcing the data protection 
law of another Member State especially for small DPAs which have limited resources for 
cooperation on such a scale. Due to the lack of detailed rules in the Directive, some DPAs 
apply the provisions on mutual assistance in the Council of Europe Convention for the 
Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data179. 
                                                 
179  ETS No. 108. 
 
EN 46   EN 
However such an approach, as well as existing non-binding mechanisms and structures in the 
framework of the WP 29, are insufficient to ensure the consistent application of data 
protection rules across the EU (see point 2.13). This situation often leads to divergent 
decisions of DPAs vis-à-vis the same data controller for the same data processing. No one 
single DPA has a complete overview of the processing activities of companies that are 
established (or, if based outside the EU, have appointed a representative) in several Member 
States.  
 
Cooperation between DPAs is insufficient and does not ensure consistent enforcement of the 
common rules within the EU, in spite of the fact that the Directive creates the duty of mutual 
cooperation and information exchange. To improve the cooperation and coordination between 
Data Protection Authorities a cooperation mechanism should be introduced which ensures the 
consistent application and enforcement of the data protection rules in all Member States 
where this concerns issues with cross-border dimension. 
 
 
10.13.Article 29 Working Party  
The Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal 
Data established by Article 29 of the Directive with advisory status180 - the so-called "Article 
29 Working Party" (WP29) - is mandated to contribute to the uniform application of the 
Directive, to give the Commission an opinion on the level of protection in the EU and in third 
countries, on codes of conduct drawn up at EU level and advise the Commission on any 
amendment of the Directive and on any measures related to the protection of the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. 
Since its creation, the Working Party has adopted 187 opinions (as at July 2011) and a variety 
of other documents. The opinions of the Working Party have dealt with topics including 
certain key concepts of the Directive, such as the opinions on the concept of personal data, the 
concepts of 'controller' and 'processor' and applicable law and on consent, as well as to the 
transfer of data to third countries and the level of protection in third countries or to specific 
issues.  
Although in some cases the opinions of the Working Party have a certain impact national 
legislation and practice – some Member States amended their data protection legislation, once 
or twice, as a result of the work of the Working Party181 – the continuing divergent 
application and interpretation of EU rules by Data Protection Authorities has not been 
resolved sufficiently. This is largely due to the fact that often DPAs are not in a position to 
enforce in their own national jurisdiction the very same principles they advocate at 
                                                 
180 The Article 29 Working Party is an advisory body composed of one representative of Member States', 
Data Protection Authorities, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the Commission 
(without voting rights), which also provides its secretariat. See:  
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/workinggroup/index_en.htm . 
181  In Member States' replies to the survey, particular reference was made  to the opinions on the concept of 
personal data (WP 136), on the concepts of data controller and data processor (WP 169), on online 
social networking and on processing by video surveillance (WP 89). 
 
EN 47   EN 
European level. Apart from the fact that the Working Party's opinions are not legally binding, 
this may be often caused by legal restraints particularly as regards the DPAs' competences and 
powers, which vary widely among Member States and the lack of a mechanism at EU level to 
ensure a coordinated application and enforcement of data protection rules (see section 2.12).  
Moreover, the fact that the Commission also ensures the secretariat of the WP29 leads to 
uncertainties as to the demarcation between the role of the Commission as an Institution, on 
the one hand, and its role as secretariat, on the other hand, particularly when the WP29 adopts 
opinions which are critical of the Commission's position. As member of the Working Party 
(albeit without voting rights) the Commission promotes its priorities, its views and requests 
for advice. In its role as secretariat, it is its role to assist the Working Party according to the 
Working Party's own priorities and approaches. 
 
The non-binding opinions of the Article 29 Working Party are insufficient to ensure the 
consistent application and interpretation of EU rules by Data Protection Authorities. The two-
fold role of the Commission, being member in the Working Party and providing at the same 
time its secretariat, bears the risk of "conflicts of interest".   
 
11.  THE MAIN RESULTS: THE NEED FOR A NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
The findings of this evaluation on key provisions of the Directive show that the problems 
encountered in the Commission's 2003 and 2007 implementation reports have not been solved 
since then. On the contrary, the problems in fully achieving its internal market policy 
objective, removing differences in the level of data protection actually afforded in the 
Member States and in ensuring effective enforcement across the EU have become more acute 
in particular due to fast and far-reaching development of digital technologies and online 
services.  
While the two-fold objective of ensuring an equivalent level of data protection amongst 
Member States and removing obstacles to the free movement of data as well as the key data 
protection principles remain valid, divergent approaches and gaps in the Directive and its 
application in Member States have led to legal fragmentation and uncertainty with negative 
consequences for businesses, individuals and the public sector and increasing difficulties for 
individuals in keeping control of their personal data. Since the Directive does not provide for 
sufficient protection in a fast-developing information society and globalised world, the 
increasing problems call for a new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the 
EU. 
 
As confirmed by the findings of this evaluation of key provision, the fragmentation and 
uncertainties in the implementation of the Directive 95/46/EC and new challenges require the 
EU to adapt the legal framework for the protection of personal data in the European Union.

DATA PROTECTION IN THE AREAS OF POLICE AND JUDICIAL  
CO-OPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS 
 
12. FRAGMENTATION OF THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF 
PERSONAL DATA IN THE AREAS OF POLICE COOPERATION AND JUDICIAL COOPERATION 
IN CRIMINAL MATTERS 
12.1. Directive 95/46/EC does not apply in these areas 
The general Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC182 applies to public and private data 
controllers and all sectors but does not apply to the processing of personal data in the areas of 
judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation.183 Furthermore, Article 13(1) 
of the Directive allows for exemptions and restrictions of some important provisions of the 
Directive (relating to data quality, information, access, and publicising), inter alia for 
safeguarding national security, defence, public security and the  prevention, investigation, 
detection and prosecution of criminal offences.184 The exclusion of the area of judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation led to the adoption of specific rules at 
EU level for police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters185.Given the lack of a single 
EU instrument on data protection in this area until the adoption of Framework Decision 
2008/977/JHA in 2008, these specific rules generally refer either to national legislation of the 
Member States, or to the Convention of the Council of Europe (ETS 108)186 and – for those 
Member States which have ratified it – to the Additional Protocol to that Convention (ETS 
181)187, as well as to the principles of the non-legally binding Recommendation No. R (87) 15

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of 
such data (‘Directive’) (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p.31). 
183 See Article 3(2), first indent, of Directive 95/46/EC: “This Directive shall not apply to the processing of 
personal data: - in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as 
those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and in any case to processing 
operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the 
State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in 
areas of criminal law”. 
184  The  majority of Member States apply the Directive to the activities of police, customs, judicial and 
other competent authorities concerned with the prevention of and the fight against crime (see 
Commission Staff Working Document SEC(2005) 1241 as well as the replies of Member States to the 
Commission's questionnaire  on the implementation of the Framework Decision).

12.2. Gaps and shortcomings in Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA 
12.2.1. Limited scope of application of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA  
Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA189 had to be implemented by Member States by 27 
November 2010 (Article 29(1)).190 It applies to personal data which for the purpose of the 
prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of 
criminal penalties are transferred between different Member States (Article 1 (2)(a)), or 
which, after having been transferred between different Member States are subsequently 
transferred to a third country or international organisation (Article 13). It furthermore applies 
to personal data which are or have been transmitted or made available by Member States to 
authorities or to information systems established on the basis of the former Title VI of the 
Treaty on European Union (‘Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters’) (Article 
1(2)(b)), or are or have been transmitted or made available to the competent authorities of the 
Member States by authorities or information systems established on the basis of the former 
Treaty on European Union or the former Treaty establishing the European Community 
(Article 1(2)(c)). 
• No application to domestic data processing: 
 
As a first consequence of the scope as described in Article 1 (2)(a), the Framework Decision 
does not apply to domestic processing operations by competent judicial or police authorities 
in the Member States, or to direct transfers from a Member State to a third country or an 
international organisation. 
 Example 1: Exchange of personal data with Interpol  
The Council Common Position 2005/69/JHA191 on exchanging certain data with the 
International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) obliges Member States to take 
the necessary measures to allow for the exchange of data between their competent law 
enforcement authorities and Interpol.  
The Framework Decision does not apply to direct exchanges of personal data by 
Member States with Interpol. 
However it would apply once personal data had been exchanged between Member 
States and then transferred to Interpol (Article 13 of the Framework Decision).

personal data in the police sector, (‘Police Recommendation’).  
189 Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA of 27.11.2008 on the protection of personal data processed 
in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (OJ L 350, 30.12.2008, p. 60) 
(‘Framework Decision’).  
190  See separate implementation report, COM(….).  
191  Council Common Position 2005/69/JHA of 24 January 2005 on exchanging certain data with Interpol, 
(OJ 2005 L 27, 29.1.2005, p. 61). 
 
EN 50   EN 
 
This distinction between personal data to be transferred or exchanged, and personal data being 
processed at domestic level only, exists neither in the relevant Council of Europe instruments, 
nor in the Directive. Both instruments apply without distinction to the processing of data 
carried out within Member States and when transferred from a Member State to a third 
country.192 As held by the ECJ in a number of cases193, the rules on the protection of 
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data 
apply regardless of whether or not there is a cross-border dimension.   
Moreover, this distinction is difficult to make in practice: personal data which have been 
gathered in a purely domestic context can hardly be factually distinguished from data that 
have been subject to cross-border transmission. A priori, any purely domestically processed 
data may be subject to cross-border transmission. It can complicate the actual implementation 
and application of the Framework Decision and other legal instruments at EU level: good co-
operation between Member States requires there to be mutual trust regarding the data 
protection of information received from other Member States. Such a high degree of trust can 
only be achieved if the protection (and the ensuing reliability) of all data which – at a later 
stage – may be transferred to other Member States, is fully ensured.  
This distinction also may lead, in these areas, to different levels of data protection in different 
Member States between personal data to be transferred or exchanged or personal data being 
processed at domestic level only. Neither Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of 
the European Union nor Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms excludes any situation or sector from the scope of protection.194  
This distinction also creates legal uncertainty – both for data subjects and for competent 
authorities – as to which rules should apply when personal data are processed by police and 
judicial authorities.  
This limited scope of the Framework Decision already leads to legal and practical deficiencies 
for the protection of personal data at EU level: more and more EU legislation creates 
harmonised legal obligations upon private or public sector data controllers requiring the 
processing and exchange of personal data for purposes of prevention, investigation, detection 
or prosecution of criminal offences, without providing for correspondingly harmonised and/or 
comprehensive provisions for the protection of personal data, as the Framework Decision 
does not apply to the domestic processing of personal data in these situations.  
This shortcoming of the Framework Decision has been pointed out also by several Member 
States during an expert meeting in February 2011 on the implementation of the Framework 
Decision. It has also been criticised by the European Data Protection Supervisor.195 The 
                                                 
192  See, e.g. Directive 95/46/EC Articles 3 and 4, and Articles 25-26. 
193  See Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 Rechnungshof, paragraphs 41-43 (op cit); Case C-376/98 
Germany v. Parliament and Council, paragraph 85; Case C-491/01 British American Tobacco and Imperial 
Tobacco, paragraph 60. 
194  In the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) TFEU a distinction is only made as far as a specific legal instrument 
for the Common Foreign and Security Policy is concerned. 
195  European Data Protection Supervisor, third opinion of 27 April 2007 on the proposal for a Council 
Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and 
judicial co-operation in criminal matters, OJ 2007 C 139, p.1. 
 
EN 51   EN 
European Parliament196, the Conference of Data Protection Authorities197, and the Council of 
Europe's T-PD Consultative Committee – consisting of data protection representatives of 
European governments – have all made clear in various occasions that the non-applicability of 
the Framework Decision to domestic processing of personal data is a key weakness.  
• Application only to ‘competent authorities:’ 
 
The Framework Decision applies to the processing of personal data by ‘competent authorities’ 
(or ‘information systems’) which transfer or make available personal data to other competent 
police or judicial authorities. In that context, ‘competent authorities’ means “agencies or 
bodies established by legal acts adopted by the Council pursuant to Title VI of the Treaty on 
European Union, as well as police, customs, judicial and other competent authorities of the 
Member States that are authorised by national law to process personal data” within the scope 
of the Framework Decision (Article 2 h)); 
However, as a second consequence of the limited scope as described above, the Framework 
Decision does not apply to activities by data controllers, which are not competent police 
or judicial authorities, but which are transferring personal data within "a framework 
established by the public authorities that relates to public security", as described by the case 
law of the ECJ and are therefore in some way connected with the prevention, investigation, 
detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties or 
enforcement of criminal law.  
This is the case e.g. for air carriers providing travellers information to police authorities of 
third countries, or internet service providers which have retained communication data for the 
purpose of fighting serious crimes, as required by Directive 2006/24/EC on data retention198. 
The Framework Decision therefore fails to address this legal uncertainty.199 
12.2.2. Low level of harmonisation of the Framework Decision 
The Framework Decision provides for a low level of harmonisation. It allows national laws 
providing for the protection of personal data at national level to impose higher safeguards 
than those established in the Framework Decision (Article 1(5)). As a consequence, national 
processing restrictions in place in one Member State have to be met by the other Member 
States (Article 12). The higher safeguards may also result from legal instruments adopted at

Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters (renewed consultation) (7315/2007 – C6-0115/2007 – 
2005/0202(CNS)). 
197  See in particular: Declaration adopted by the European Data Protection Authorities in Cyprus on 11 
May 2007 and the Common position of the European Data Protection Authorities on the use of the 
concept of availability in law enforcement Cyprus, 10. - 11. May 2007.

(OJ L 105, 13.4.2006, p. 54). 
199  See the Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the Communication from the 
Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the follow-up of the Work Programme for 
better implementation of the Data Protection Directive (OJ C 255, 27.10.2007, p. 1). See also the EDPS 
Annual Report 2006, p. 47. 
 
EN 52   EN 
EU level its Article 28 also states: “where in acts adopted prior to the date of entry into force 
of this Framework Decision and regulating the exchange of personal data between Member 
States [...] specific conditions have been introduced as to the use of such data by the receiving 
Member State these conditions shall take precedence over the provisions of this Framework 
Decision” (see below § 1.3). 
Furthermore, the Framework Decision also ‘does not affect’ Convention 108 and its 
Additional Protocol (recital 41), thereby leaving it open for interpretation if its level of 
protection is ‘at least equal’ to the one of the Convention 108.  
By contrast, other former third pillar instruments require Member States explicitly to adopt 
national data protection provisions in order to achieve a level of protection of personal data 
‘at least equal’ to that resulting from the Convention 108 (Schengen Implementing 
Convention Aricle 126) or additionally to the Additional Protocol with the Police 
Recommendation (Prüm Decision Article 25).  
12.2.3. No powers of EU institutions vis-à-vis the Framework Decision  
As to the powers of the EU institutions, Protocol 36 on Transitional provisions annexed to the 
Treaty of Lisbon provides that the Commission has no infringement powers in the case of the 
Framework Decision (Article 10). Also, the powers of the Court of Justice are to remain the 
same with respect to those acts in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in 
criminal matters which were adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Till 
these transitional measures cease to have effect five years after the date of entry into force of 
the Treaty of Lisbon, this legal status of the Framework Decision has implications to the 
extent that current rules for data controllers are not uniform and coherent across the EU. 
Furthermore, the Commission does not have implementing powers and there is no 
competence for the Article 29 Working Party composed by DPAs aiming at fostering 
common interpretation. 
12.3. The Framework Decision’s relationship with other legal instruments 
12.3.1. Unclear rules of precedence 
The Framework Decision did not replace or specifically amend the various existing sector-
specific legislative instruments for police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters with 
data protection provisions. The articulation between the Framework Decision and these other 
data protection provisions contained in ex third pillar legal acts is not always clear.  
Article 28 of the Framework Decision spells out a rule of precedence of acts adopted prior 
to the date of entry into force of the Framework Decision (19.1.2009).  
However, some former third pillar acts have been adopted after the entry into force of 
the Framework Decision. This includes:  
 
EN 53   EN 
- Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on criminal records exchange200, which states that 
its specific data protection rules complement the general data protection rules in force, but 
with no specific reference to Framework Decision (recital 13 in the preamble); 
- Decision 2009/316/JHA on the establishment of the criminal records system ECRIS201, 
which implements Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on this issue, states that the 
Framework Decision ‘should’ apply in the context of computerised exchange of data 
between Member States, while allowing Member States to set higher levels of protection 
(recital 18 in the preamble); 
- Decision 2009/371/JHA establishing Europol202, which replaced the prior Europol 
Convention and Protocols as from 1 January 2010, equally provides that the Framework 
Decision on data protection applies to the processing by Member States of the data to 
Europol, but that as regards Europol as such, the data protection rules in the Europol 
Decision replaced the general rules of the Framework Decision because of the ‘particular 
nature, functions and competences of Europol’ (recital 12 in the preamble); the same 
applies to two implementing decisions on Europol analysis work files203, and on Europol’s 
relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified 
information204; 
- Amending Decision 2009/426/JHA to the Decision establishing Eurojust205 specifies that 
the Framework Decision on data protection applies to the processing by Member States of 
the data transmitted between the Member States and Eurojust, but that the data protection 
rules applying to Eurojust as such (as amended by this later Decision) are not affected by 
the Framework Decision, because of the ‘particular nature, functions and competences of 
Eurojust’ (recital 13 in the preamble);  
- Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the recognition of pre-trial supervision 
orders206 also states that the Framework Decision applies to personal data exchange 
within its scope (recital 19 in the preamble);

- Decision 2009/917/JHA establishing the Customs Information System (CIS)207, which 
replaces the CIS-Convention and its Protocols as from 27 May 2011 (Art 34), contains a 
number of specific references to the Framework Decision, which applies to the CIS unless 
otherwise provided for in the Decision (Art 20);  
- Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA on conflicts of jurisdiction208 states that the 
Framework Decision applies to personal data exchange within its scope (recital 18).  
As regards the acts adopted prior to the entry into force of the Framework Decision, 
Article 28 does not clarify whether "specific conditions as to the use of such data by the 
receiving Member State" should also relate to general principles for the protection of personal 
data, such as guaranteeing lawful processing or supervision by independent data protection 
authorities or if they are only to be understood as being limited to conditions of use, e.g. a 
prohibition to process personal data supplied for the prevention of criminal offences for a 
major event with a cross border dimension for other purposes.  
Recital 39 lists some existing measures which are deemed to set out a “complete and 
coherent set of rules” regarding data protection and remain unaffected by the Framework 
Decision. This creates legal uncertainty, in particular, because there is no exhaustive list of 
legal instruments that are to remain unaffected. As a consequence, it is left to the 
interpretation on a case-by-case basis which rules apply to a concrete situation. Furthermore, 
despite explicit references in the recital (but not in the legal text itself), it is not entirely clear 
whether the specific rules in these measures mentioned apply entirely instead of the rules in 
the Framework Decision or if the Framework Decision could apply e.g. in case of possible 
gaps in the legal instruments cited. 
As regards measures targeted by recital 40 of the Framework Decision which have “more 
limited data protection rules”, they apply instead of the Framework Decision if the conditions 
imposed – as to the use or further transfer of personal data - on receiving Member States are 
‘more restrictive’ than the Framework Decision, but otherwise the Framework Decision 
applies. Again, this leaves a large room for interpretation and therefore does not provide legal 
certainty neither for individuals nor for police and other competent authorities.  
 
12.3.2. Differences in content between the Framework Decision and the other legal 
instruments with specific data protection provisions 
A comparison of the substantive rules contained in the Framework Decision with the 
abovementioned other legal instruments with data protection relevance, in particular Directive 
95/46/EC, shows differences in content, some of which are presented below. 
• Definition of ‘personal data’: 
                                                 
207  Council Decision 2009/917/JHA of 30 November 2009 on the use of information technology for 
customs purposes (OJ L 323, 10.12.2009, p 20). 
208  Council Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA of 30 November 2009 on prevention and settlement of 
conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 42). 
 
EN 55   EN 
The definition of ‘personal data’ (Article 2 (a) Directive) can equally be found e.g. in the 
Framework Decision (Article 2 (a)), while the definitions used for the SIS II Decision (Article 
3 (d), or the CIS Decision (Article 2 No. 2) are only identical as to the main part of the 
definition, and do not describe further what is to be understood under an ‘identifiable person’. 
The Prüm Decision adds that “processing within the meaning of this Decision shall also 
include notification of whether or not a hit exists” (Article 24 (1) a)). 
 
• Limitations to the purpose limitation principle: 
The Directive requires personal data to be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate 
purposes and prohibits further processing in a way incompatible with those purposes (Article 
6(1)(b)).  
While the Framework Decision does lay down similar principles in its Article 3, it leaves it 
explicitly to the Member States to determine more precisely at national level which other 
purposes are to be considered as incompatible with the purpose for which the personal data 
were originally collected (recital 6). It also provides for further exceptions from the purpose 
limitation rule, as regards data received from other Member States (Article 11), including 
further processing for “any other purpose”, with the prior consent of the transmitting Member 
State or with the consent of the data subject, given in accordance with national law (Article 11 
(d)). Equally, the Prüm Decision provides that although processing of personal data by the 
receiving Member State is ‘permitted solely’ for the purposes for which the data have been 
originally transferred, processing ‘for other purposes’ is admissible with prior authorisation of 
the Member State administering the file and subject to the national laws of both receiving and 
administering Member State (Article 26). A similar provision exists in the CIS Decision 
(Article 8).  
In consequence, a provision permitting processing ‘for other purposes’ means that in practice 
any personal data, including sensitive data, processed by a competent police authority in one 
Member State and transmitted to another Member State may be processed for different 
purposes other than those for which they were originally collected and then transmitted and 
thereby emptying the purpose limitation principle of its value. In this context, the “consent” or 
“authorisation” of the transmitting authority cannot be considered under any circumstances as 
providing a valid legal ground to derogate from the purpose limitation principle. 
• Periodic review of personal data processed: 
The periodic review provided for by Article 5 of the Framework Decision refers to review of 
the need for the storage of the data but does not ensure the periodic verification of data quality 
and does not ensure that police files are purged in practice of superfluous data and kept up to 
date.209 The importance of such review is important both to ensure individuals' rights and for 
the efficient operation of police services.  
                                                 
209  As foreseen by principles 3 and 7 of the Police Recommendation. See the Opinion of the European Data 
Protection Supervisor on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the 
Council on the follow-up of the Work Programme for better implementation of the Data Protection 
Directive (OJ C 255, 27.10.2007, p. 1). See also the EDPS Annual Report 2006, p. 47. 
 
EN 56   EN 
• Information to the data subject:  
Under the Framework Decision (Article 16), Member States have to ensure that their 
competent authorities inform data subjects of processing, unless national law provides 
otherwise or in cases of transfer to another Member State where that Member State has 
requested that the data subject is not to be informed. The Framework Decision does not 
specify form, content and modalities of that information and leaves this to national law. 
Under the Europol and Prüm Decisions it is established that when a data subject is informed it 
must be in an ‘intelligible’ or ‘comprehensible’ form. Under the Prüm Decision it must be 
free of charge.  
• Right of access:  
Under the Framework Decision (Article 17), a data subject has the right to obtain, without 
constraint or excessive delay or expense, either: 
(a)  at least a confirmation from the controller or from the national supervisory authority 
as to whether or not data relating to him have been transmitted or made available and 
information on the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data have been 
disclosed and communication of the data undergoing processing, or 
(b)  at least a confirmation from the national supervisory authority that all necessary 
verifications have taken place. 
This information or confirmation can either be provided directly by the competent authority 
(“direct access”) or by the supervisory authority (“indirect access”)210. Member States may 
legislate restrictions to this right of access, in order to avoid obstructing official or legal 
inquiries, investigations or procedures; prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation 
and prosecution of criminal offences or for the execution of criminal penalties; protecting 
public security; protecting national security; and protecting the data subject or the rights and 
freedoms of others (Article 17 (2)). Any refusals on behalf of the controller to provide this 
information must be made in writing (Article17 (3)).  
Both the 2002 Eurojust Decision (Article 19) and the Europol Decision (Article 30) provide 
for a specific right of access in a detailed provision. Other than these instruments, out of 26 
other instruments, only six provide for a specific right of access in a specific provision: the 
Schengen Implementing Convention (Article 109), the SIS II Decision (Article 58), the 
Naples II Convention (Article 25), the Prüm Decision (Article 31), the VIS access Decision211 
                                                 
210  This latter possibility is destined for those Member States which have provided for the right of access of 
the data subject in criminal matters through a system where the national supervisory authority, in place 
of the data subject, has access to all the personal data related to the data subject without any restriction 
and may also rectify, erase or update inaccurate data. In such a case of indirect access, the national law 
of those Member States may provide that the national supervisory authority will inform the data subject 
only that all the necessary verifications have taken place. This seems to appliy, in particular, in France 
and Belgium. 
211  Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa 
Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes 
of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences  
(OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 129). 
 
EN 57   EN 
(Article 14) and the CIS Decision (Article 22). All these instruments require the right of 
access to be exercised in accordance with national law (in the case of the CIS Decision, 
implementing the Framework Decision) and some allow the national supervisory authority to 
decide whether and how that right can be exercised (SIC, SIS II, VIS Access Decision). The 
involvement of other MS before granting access is expressly foreseen (SIC, SIS II, Naples II, 
VIS access). Only the Prüm Decision lays down further details as to which information is to 
be given (e.g. which data are being processed, legal basis for the processing, etc.). All lay 
down grounds for refusal for access, but while similar use different grounds and differently 
wording.  
• Rights to correction, deletion and blocking of data:  
Under the Framework Decision a data subject has the right to obtain, without constraint or 
excessive delay or expense, confirmation of data processing (Article 17(1)). Any refusals on 
behalf of the controller to provide this information must be made in writing (Article17 (3)). 
The data subject also has the right to request rectification, erasure or blocking of personal data 
(Article 18(1)). Each Member State will decide whether the request must be made to the data 
controller or to the national supervisory authority. Any refusals on behalf of the controller to 
rectify, erase or block data must be made in writing to the data subject (Article 18(1)).  
Under other legislative acts with access rights provisions, concrete time limits have been 
established by which requests made by data subjects must be dealt with. Under the Europol 
Decision, a subject requesting the deletion or correction of data will be informed of the 
outcome of their request within a maximum of three months (Article 31(5)). Under the 
Eurojust Decision, requests of access must also be dealt with within a maximum of three 
months and access to data are free of charge (Article 19(2)). Under Schengen legislation and 
the VIS Decision, requests for deletion must be dealt with within 60 days.  
• Transfers to third countries or international organisations:   
The Framework Decision establishes that personal data may be transferred to competent 
authorities in third States or to international bodies. This is generally allowed if ‘adequate 
protection’ is provided, and it is necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or 
prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties, and with the prior 
authorisation of the original Member State (Article 13). The assessment of adequacy is left to 
the Member States on the basis of indicative criteria (see the text of Article 13 (4) DPFD).  
There are also several exceptions to this rule, in particular when the national law of the 
transferring Member States so provides because of ‘legitimate prevailing interests’ (Article 
13(3)). These specific rules on the transfer of data to third states or international bodies differ 
significantly from those applicable under the Directive (Articles 25, 26).  
Example 2: Third country data transfers 
Member State A considers that a third country X with which it has a bilateral data 
transfer agreement ensures an ‘adequate’ level of protection.  
Member State B did not conclude a similar bilateral agreement with the same third 
country X and does not consider that country X ensures an ‘adequate’ level of 
protection.  
 
EN 58   EN 
Under the rules of the Framework Decision, Member State A is able to transfer 
personal data of individuals from Member State B, if transmitted to it by Member 
State B previously, to third country X – in emergencies without Member State B’s 
authorisation. 
Had third country X requested this personal data directly from Member State B, third 
country X would not have received the data directly from Member State B as Member 
State B considers X as not ensuring an 'adequate' level of protection and would 
prohibit the transfer. 
Other instruments also allow for the transfer of data to third countries or international 
organisations: by way of example, under the SIS II Decision, data cannot be transferred to 
third countries or to international organisations except for stolen, misappropriated, lost or 
invalidated passports, which may be exchanged with members of Interpol by establishing a 
connection between SIS II and the Interpol database on stolen or missing travel documents. 
The VIS Decision Article 8(4) says that VIS data shall not be transferred or made available to 
a third country or to an international organisation. However, in an exceptional case of urgency 
such data may be transferred or made available to a third country/international organisation 
exclusively for the purposes of the prevention and detection of terrorist offences and of other 
serious criminal offences subject to the consent of the originating MS.  
The Framework Decision is furthermore ‘without prejudice’ to existing obligations and 
commitments incumbent upon Member States or upon the Union by virtue of bilateral and/or 
multilateral agreements with third States existing at the time of its adoption (Article 26), e.g. 
to the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the 
Kingdom of Norway on the surrender procedure between the Member States of the 
European Union and Iceland and Norway212 or the Agreement between the European Union 
and Iceland and Norway on the application of certain provisions of the Prüm Decision213. 
However, future agreements have to comply with the rules on exchanges with third States: 
Article 26 provides for the application of conditions of Article 13 (1)(c) or (2) when falling 
within the scope of the Framework Decision. 
• Supervisory authorities 
As in the Directive, the Framework Decision recognises that the establishment in Member 
States of supervisory authorities, exercising their functions with complete independence, is an 
essential component of the protection of personal data processed within the framework of 
police and judicial cooperation between the Member States. It also allows that the supervisory 
authorities already established in Member States under the Directive to assume such 
responsibility (recitals 33, 34). The Prüm Decision also refers specifically to a supervisory 
authority within the meaning of the Directive (Article 31).

213  Council Decision of 21 September 2009 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and on the 
provisional application of certain provisions of the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland 
and Norway on the application of certain provisions of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping 
up of cross- border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime and Council 
Decision 2008/616/JHA on the implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-
border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, and the Annex thereto 
(2009/1023/JHA), (OJ L 353, 31.12.2009, p.1). 
 
EN 59   EN 
The Framework Decision does not establish rules related to the existing joint supervisory 
authorities. The instruments concerning Europol, Eurojust and CIS make specific provisions 
for the establishment up of a joint supervisory authority. The Europol Decision obliges an 
Independent Joint Supervisory Body to be set up to review the activities of Europol in order to 
ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated through the storage, processing and use of 
the data held in Europol.214. 
The Framework Decision does not establish any provisions concerning the European Data 
Protection Supervisor (EDPS). In this respect, the CIS Decision stipulates that the EDPS is to 
supervise the activities of the Commission regarding the CIS. The SIS II Decision (when it 
will be applicable) envisages that the EDPS will supervise processing activities of the 
Management Authority of SIS II; the same is the case also for the VIS decision. The VIS 
Regulation further stipulates that the EDPS is responsible for checking that personal data 
processing activities of the Management Authority are carried out in accordance with the VIS 
Regulation. The EDPS is also to ensure that data processing activities carried out by the 
Management Authority are audited. Under the SIS II Decision the EDPS is to act as a 
mediator between Member States in disputes regarding the correction or deletion of data.  
13. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND OTHER STANDARDS  
The protection of personal data is recognised as a fundamental right and has been interpreted 
by the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECtHR). 
13.1. Fundamental Rights Standards 
13.1.1. Case law interpreting Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights 
Important case law provided guidance for the interpretation of this fundamental right by the 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) in particular in the following cases: Commission v Federal 
Republic of Germany215, concerning the lack of independence of the national supervisory 
authorities, and Schecke et al.216 As underlined by the ECJ in the latter decision, the 
fundamental right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but must be 
considered in relation to its function in society. Article 8(2) of the Charter thus authorises the 
processing of personal data if certain conditions are satisfied. It provides that personal data 
‘must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person 
concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law’.  
                                                 
214  According to Eurojust legislation the Joint Supervisory Body comprises a judge appointed by each 
Member State who is not a member of Eurojust, whereas under the CIS Decision, a Joint Supervisory 
Authority consists of two representatives from each Member State’s respective independent national 
supervisory authority. For the SIS, Europol and the CIS, there is a Joint secretariat. See Council 
Decision of 17 October 2000 establishing a secretariat for the joint supervisory data-protection bodies 
set up by the Convention on the Establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention), the 
Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention 
implementing the Schengen Agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders 
(Schengen Convention) (OJ L 271, 24/10/2000, p.1).

EN 60   EN 
13.1.2. Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights of the Council of 
Europe (ECHR) 
Under Article 8 of the ECHR European Convention of Human Rights of the Council of 
Europe (ECHR), “everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home 
and his correspondence.” Data protection emerges from the jurisprudence of the European 
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg as an aspect of privacy protection. The case law is 
particularly relevant for the police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.  
The ECtHR has found in Article 8 ECHR not only negative obligations for the Member States 
to abstain from interfering with the right to privacy, but also positive obligations, that entail 
‘the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the 
relations of individuals themselves’.217  In M.S. v. Sweden218, for instance, the ECtHR made 
clear that ‘the protection of personal data [...] is of fundamental importance to a person’s 
enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 
of the Convention’.  
 
The collection of information by officials of the State about an individual will always concern 
his or her private life and will thus fall within the scope of Article 8 (1) ECHR. This includes 
for example: an official census which includes compulsory questions relating to the sex, 
marital status, place of birth and other personal details219; the recording of fingerprinting, 
photography and other personal information by the police220even if the police register is 
secret221; the collection of medical data and the maintenance of medical records222; the 
compulsion by state authorities to reveal details of personal expenditure (and thus intimate 
details of private life)223; records relating to past criminal cases224; information relating to 
terrorist activity225, collecting personal information in order to protect national security226. 
 
13.1.3. Possible limitations to the fundamental right to personal data protection and to 
private life 
Limitations on the right to privacy and data protection may be applied only when certain 
conditions are met. Article 8(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights accepts 
interference only where it is "in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic 
society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the 
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for 
the protection of the rights and freedoms of others".

Article 52(1) of the Charter accepts limitations only where they are "provided for by law and 
respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, 
limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general 
interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others". 
These are the provisions that serve as a frame of reference for the Court of Justice, which 
follows the lead of the European Court of Human Rights (Court of Human Rights) on this 
matter, when examining the compatibility of a data-processing measure with the rights 
in question227. 
Once an interference or infringement of the rights has been established, then, in application of 
the Court of Human Rights criterion that "[t]he mere storing of data relating to the private 
life of an individual amounts to an interference",228 the grounds for that interference must be 
examined, which involves three cumulative conditions229 that the interference or infringement 
must: 
(1) be in accordance with the law, which requires in particular:  
- that the measure "should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the 
quality of the law in question, [which] should be accessible to the person concerned 
and foreseeable as to its effects"230;  
- rules involving negative consequences for individuals should be clear and precise and 
their application predictable for those subject to them231;  
- that the measure must be foreseeable, i.e. drawn up with sufficient precision to enable 
the individual to regulate his conduct"232. It is "essential […] to have clear, detailed 
rules governing the scope and application of measures, as well as minimum 
safeguards concerning, inter alia, duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, 
procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for 
its destruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse and 
arbitrariness"233. 
- States "do not enjoy an unlimited discretion to subject persons within their jurisdiction 
to secret surveillance" and must provide adequate and effective guarantees against 
abuse". 234

EN 62   EN 
(2) meet a general-interest objective recognised by the Union (legitimate aim): 
Article 52(1) of the Charter requires that the restrictions imposed on the exercise of the rights 
in question "genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union"235. 
Article 8(2) of the ECHR lists the various legitimate goals, including national security, public 
safety and the prevention of crime". 
         (3) be necessary and respond effectively to a general-interest objective:  
This condition presupposes a review of proportionality according to settled case-law of the 
Court of Justice "the principle of proportionality, which is one of the general principles of 
European Union law, requires that measures implemented by acts of the European Union are 
appropriate for attaining the objective pursued and do not go beyond what is necessary to 
achieve it".236  
The objective pursued must in effect be reconciled with the fundamental rights set forth in 
Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter.237 It is thus necessary to balance on the one hand "the 
European Union's interest" in improving security through the prevention and combating of 
crime and, on the other hand, "the interference with the right of [individual data subjects] to 
respect for their private life in general and to the protection of their personal data in 
particular".238  
As they constitute exceptions to the fundamental rights, grounds for interference are "to be 
interpreted narrowly"239 and "must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary"240. 
A limitation imposed on the rights in question, is justified only if it is "proportionate to the 
legitimate aim pursued"241 and "necessary in a democratic society" to attain a legitimate aim, 
and, in particular, that it is "proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and [that] the 
reasons adduced by the (…) authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient".242 The 
authorities "enjoy a margin of appreciation, the scope of which will depend not only on the 
nature of the legitimate aim pursued but also on the particular nature of the interference 
involved".243 
It is therefore necessary to examine whether any proposed measure does not "go beyond what 
[is] necessary for achieving the legitimate aims pursued, having regard in particular to the 
interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter".244

It is apparent from the case-law of the Court of Human Rights that a measure authorising 
"so-called exploratory or general surveillance" would contravene Article 8 of the ECHR245. 
Similarly, "the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention" of data 
(fingerprints, biological samples and DNA profiles) "of persons suspected but not convicted 
of offences", which are "retained irrespective of the nature or gravity of the offence with 
which the individual was originally suspected or of the age of the suspected offender" and 
without restriction of time, "overstep[s] any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard 
[and] constitutes a disproportionate interference with the […] right to respect for 
private life"246. 
ECHR case law: 
In Leander v Sweden247, the Court held that the storing of information relating to an 
individual’s private life in a secret register and the release of such information 
amounted to an interference with his right to respect for private life as guaranteed by 
Article 8(1).  
In Rotaru v Romania248, the ECtHR reiterated that the storing by a public authority of 
information relating to an individual’s private life and the use of it amount to 
interference with the right to respect for private life and added that such an 
interference occurred also from the refusal to allow an opportunity for the personal 
data to be refuted.  
In Amann v Switzerland249, the Court found that the storing of a card containing data 
relating to an individual’s private life and stored by an authority storage itself 
amounted to an interference with the right to respect for his private life.  
In S. and Marper v. United Kingdom250 the ECtHR ruled on the lawfulness of the 
retention of fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles after criminal 
proceedings against the applicants were terminated by an acquittal or discharge and 
despite the applicants had requested their destruction. The retention of both cellular 
samples and DNA profiles amounted to an interference with the applicants’ right to 
respect for their private lives. The Court reiterated that as for the storing and use of 
this personal information, it was essential to have clear, detailed rules governing the 
scope and application of measures, as well as minimum safeguards. The protection 
afforded by Article 8 would be unacceptably weakened if the use of modern 
scientific techniques in the criminal justice system were allowed at any cost and 
without carefully balancing the potential benefits of the extensive use of such 
techniques against important private-life interests.

The Court found that it amounts to a violation of Article 8 that fingerprints, cellular 
samples and DNA profiles could be retained by police authorities irrespective of the 
nature or gravity of the offence with which the individual was originally suspected or 
of the age of the suspected offender; if the retention was not time-limited; and if 
there existed only limited possibilities for an acquitted individual to have the data 
removed from the nationwide database or to have the materials destroyed. It 
expressly found that that the retention of unconvicted persons’ data could be 
especially harmful in the case of minors such, given their special situation and the 
importance of their development and integration in society 
13.2. Other standards (Council of Europe) 
Additionally, certain standards included in Recommendation No R (87) 15 of the Committee 
of Ministers of the Council of Europe are also useful benchmarks in this area, in particular: 
– The need to distinguish personal data according to their degree of accuracy and 
reliability, or whether they are based on facts or on opinions or personal assessments. 
The lack of such a requirement could actually undermine the data being exchanged 
between police authorities as they will not be able to ascertain whether the data can be 
construed as ‘evidence’, ‘fact’, ‘hard intelligence’ or ‘soft intelligence’. This could have 
the consequence of hampering security operations and of making it more difficult for 
courts to secure convictions; 
 
– The need to distinguish between different categories of data subjects (criminals, 
suspects, victims, witnesses, etc.), and to provide in particular for specific guarantees 
for data relating to non-suspects. Again, these distinctions are on the one hand 
necessary for the protection of the concerned individuals and on the other hand for the 
ability of the recipient law enforcement authorities to be able to make full use of the 
data they receive251.

ANNEX 4 
 
SUMMARY OF REPLIES TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE COMMISSION'S 
COMMUNICATION ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ON PERSONAL DATA 
PROTECTION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
 
 
Following the adoption of the Commission's Communication of 4 November 2010 on "A 
comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union" a public 
consultation was launched on the ideas therein. The deadline for replies to the consultation 
was 15 January 2011. The Commission received 305 responses, of which 54 from citizens, 31 
from public authorities and 220 from private organisations, in particular business associations 
and non-governmental organisations. The full text of these responses is available at 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/news/consulting_public/news_consulting_0006_en.htm, except 
where respondents asked to remain anonymous or to have their entire contribution treated as 
confidential.252 
This document provides a factual and objective summary of the contributions received during 
the public consultation. While the summary is structured along the issues identified in the 
Commission's abovementioned Communication, the views and opinions expressed are not 
necessarily those of the Commission. 
 
1. STRENGTHENING INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS 
1.1. Ensuring appropriate protection for individuals in all circumstances 
The Commission will consider how to ensure a coherent application of data protection 
rules, taking into account the impact of new technologies on individuals' rights and 
freedoms and the objective of ensuring the free circulation of personal data within the 
internal market. 
 
- Coherence 
The coherent application of data protection rules was considered particularly important by 
large private companies, who insisted on having a coherent and uniform framework. Across 
industry, stakeholders felt that the current lack of harmonisation is detrimental to economic 
                                                 
252 288 out of the 305 responses are available on the website. 
 
EN 69   EN 
activity within the EU. Many stakeholders also pointed out that data protection rules should 
be coherent with existing sectoral regulation, such as the rules in the media sector (freedom to 
inform, journalistic rights and exemptions), the police and justice sector (specificities 
regarding access to data rights), the history and archiving sector (access to historical 
documents), the communications sector (security of networks, services and information), the 
health sector (collection of data for pharmacovigilance), and the research sector (recognition 
of scientific purposes as a substantial public interest, exemptions and safeguards for further 
processing of personal data). 
Many contributors referred to the challenges to data protection posed by technological 
developments, such as cloud computing or social networks, and urged the legislator to 
respond to these in a concrete and coherent manner. Some propose to introduce sectoral 
legislation to specifically address these issues (following the model of e-Privacy directive). 
Similarly, a number of citizens complained about the apparent lack of regulation of the 
internet as far as personal data is concerned. A consistent privacy experience online is seen as 
vital in order to have trust in the internet. 
Some stakeholders, including citizens, mentioned that a coherent application of the rules is 
only possible if definitions are clear, especially the definitions of "personal data", "data 
controller" and "processor". Some contributors suggested to change the current core 
definitions. For instance, some proposed to foresee that identification is not the only element 
in defining personal data and suggested to keep the personal data definition broad in order to 
anticipate possible evolution of new technologies and behavioural profiling. A group of 
researchers suggested to exclude from the definition of personal data any information whose 
processing does not interfere with the values of privacy, fairness and non-discrimination. 
Some DPAs wished to reconsider the categories of sensitive data by possibly moving towards 
a definition of the content which might be considered sensitive instead of prescribing an 
exhaustive list of sensitive data. A more radical proposal consisted of eliminating the general 
prohibition to process sensitive data and foreseeing instead a special obligation to ensure 
appropriate safeguards for such processing. Some public research institutions touched upon 
the need for further clarification and harmonisation of the existing definitions, especially the 
concepts of personal data, anonymous data and encoded data.  
 
DPAs insisted on the need for coherent enforcement mechanisms in order to ensure the 
coherent application of data protection rules. Some pointed out the need to make use of 
existing rules and strenghen self-regulation or self-enforcement. Indeed, a number of public 
authorities argued that the issue at hand is less the strenghening of rights but rather the proper 
application of the existing Directive. Other stakeholders, including business assocations, 
consider that in order to reach greater coherence of the data protection legal framework, an 
obligation of mutual recognition of the national data protection regimes between Member 
States should be introduced. 
According to some public authorities and citizens more competition between internet 
providers, and hence less dependency on providers with a dominant market share, could 
strengthen internet users’ self-determination and exercise of their rights. Currently, some 
services depend on a specific platform or there is no data portability (possibility for 
 
EN 70   EN 
individuals to take their data with them when they move from one (social) network to 
another). 
 
Some DPAs felt the need to shift the focus of regulation from all data processing operations to 
risky data processing in order to take into account today's technological reality. Accordingly, 
rules for daily, harmless data processing (such as processing of an unstructured documents 
like ordinary email or publication of personal data in running text on the internet) should be 
simplified, by permitting such processing without any additional requirements, unless it leads 
to an inappropriate encroachment of the individual's privacy. The focus on the areas which 
involve specific risks would increase respect and compliance with the regulation.  
 
In this context, some stakeholders expect the new legal framework to explicitly state that the 
right to data protection will sometimes need to be balanced with other equally important 
fundamental rights.  
1.2. Increasing transparency for data subjects 
The Commission will consider: 
- introducing a general principle of transparent processing of personal data in the legal 
framework; 
- introducing specific obligations for data controllers on the type of information to be 
provided and on the modalities for providing it, including in relation to children; 
- drawing up one or more EU standard forms (‘privacy information notices’) to be used by 
data controllers. 
 
Transparency 
Stakeholders generally agree on the importance of the principle of transparent processing. 
Many respondents, in particular businesses, noted that the notion of transparency is already an 
integral part of the present legal framework through Articles 10, 11, 12, 15 and 6.1(a) of the 
Directive. While some respondents argue that an inclusion of an explicit transparency 
principle would increase legal certainty, others consider it more important to reinforce the 
existing provisions.  
One citizen proposed a standard obligation whereby (online) companies should once a year 
send an e-mail summary of all personal information held linked to a given e-mail address. 
Another citizen proposed creating a special icon on internet browser screens to inform 
individuals about the data processing (e.g. profiling, behavioral advertising), indicate the type 
of information collected and the identity of the processor. A similar suggestion is submitted 
by a group of privacy experts. This system would enable consumers to know about the 
processing of their data and give a meaningful consent prior to the collection of tracked data. 
 
EN 71   EN 
Children 
Citizens are generally very concerned about privacy risks entailed by childrens' online 
activities and support age verification and other controls or additional protection mechanisms. 
Several stakeholders insisted on clearly defining what a child is (age) and establishing 
specific requirements for the processing of children's personal data. One NGO argued that 
children should be able to exercise their own privacy rights (distinct from their parents) and 
that privacy notices and consent forms should to be adapted to the level of awareness of the 
child.  
DPAs and civil society organisations strongly agree that more consideration should be given 
to privacy-related children's issues. Some support additional legal provisions related to 
requirements for information provided to children, protection from behavioral advertising, 
categories of data which can never be collected, age treshhold, parental consent to be included 
in the revised legal instrument. By contrast, some others – pointing to the diverse rules for 
defining a child across the EU, different levels of maturity and understanding of children of 
the same age, as well as practical difficulties related to age verification and mechanisms for 
obtaining consent – do not support detailed provisions on children. Several respondents 
indicated that a gradual approach regarding the responsibility of the child should be taken 
based on different national age limits for criminal, administrative and civil responsibility.  
Though some restrictions may be needed for children especially regarding sharing of 
information online and exposure to behavioural advertising, some contributors argued that 
teenagers sometimes have a better understanding of online privacy challenges than their 
parents. 
Privacy information notices  
Some organisations, in particular large companies, support a standard EU form as a practical 
means to inform stakeholders, while others would prefer general guidance based on best 
practices. Organisations that support the introduction of EU standard forms argue that the 
varying requirements across the EU regarding privacy notices create administrative burden for 
data controllers and little added value for consumers. 
Public authorities endorse the Commission’s view that transparent processing requires the 
availability to data subjects of clear, easy to understand privacy information notices. 
However, some authorities are not convinced that EU standard forms are the best way to meet 
this need due to the specificity of the context and possible particular needs of the data subjects 
at whom they are aimed. Therefore, some institutions propose to develop forms of general 
nature or forms which serve as recommendations or guidelines. 
 
The Commission will: 
- examine the modalities for the introduction in the general legal framework of a general 
personal data breach notification, including the addressees of such notifications and the 
criteria for triggering the obligation to notify. 
 
EN 72   EN 
Data breach notifications 
There is general support that data breach notifications need to be extended beyond the 
Telecom sector and the e-Privacy Directive, especially from public authorities. Data breach 
notifications are seen as a key element of transparency and accountability. Information is 
crucial for the individual to exercise his or her rights, for instance to claim financial 
compensation.  
As far as the thresholds are concerned, respondents argue that a pragmatic approach should be 
foreseen, lessons from the experiences of the telecom sector should be drawn and 
overnotification should be avoided, in the interest of both businesses and data protection 
authorities. Some contributions highlight that data breaches in the public sector should be 
covered, as well as data breaches occuring in foreign countries, when they impact EU citizens.  
Industry argues that no administrative burden should be created for riskless / insignificant 
breaches. For instance, the banking sector argued that data breaches are already reported on a 
voluntary basis, where appropriate, and that an obligatory requirement should be limited to 
serious cases. 
 
Archives institutions argue that their special circumstances should be acknowledged; they 
consider it impracticable to attempt to ascertain the current contact details of the very large 
number (millions) of data subjects featuring in archives in the event of a data breach. 
1.3. Enhancing control over one's own data 
The Commission will therefore examine ways of: 
- strengthening the principle of data minimisation; 
- improving the modalities for the actual exercise of the rights of access, rectification, 
erasure or blocking of data (e.g., by introducing deadlines for responding to individuals' 
requests, by allowing the exercise of rights by electronic means or by providing that right of 
access should be ensured free of charge as a principle); 
- clarifying the so-called ‘right to be forgotten’, i.e. the right of individuals to have their data 
no longer processed and deleted when they are no longer needed for legitimate purposes. This 
is the case, for example, when processing is based on the person's consent and when he or she 
withdraws consent or when the storage period has expired; 
- complementing the rights of data subjects by ensuring ’data portability’, i.e., providing the 
explicit right for an individual to withdraw his/her own data (e.g., his/her photos or a list of 
friends) from an application or service so that the withdrawn data can be transferred into 
another application or service, as far as technically feasible, without hindrance from the data 
controllers. 
 
EN 73   EN 
Data minimisation 
Many citizens report a widespread practice of collection of excessive (beyond the specific 
purpose) personal information on the internet. They also expect more options to remain 
anonymous in the virtual environment.  
Public institutions, in particular DPAs and advisory bodies, agree with the importance of data 
minimisation, which can provide effective data protection, guarantee the rights of data 
subjects and promote best practise by data controllers. However, some respondents underlined 
that the principle should be clearly defined in order to ensure adequate implementation.  
Service providers and industry noted that data processing can be beneficial to consumers and 
in particular business sectors (e.g. finance, insurance) and business models and therefore, not 
all the personal data need to be minimised. Some industry representatives, including trade 
organisations, considered that the data minimisation principle is already expressed in the 
Directive. Some expressed concerns that the principle of data minimisation might conflict 
with other industry legal requirements to retain data for official legally sanctioned purposes.  
Some stakeholders in the service area (healthcare/advertising) fear that reinforcing data 
minimisation rules would lead to further restrictions on secondary use of data, which could 
restrict their professional activities. Also some business stakeholders fear that this would lead 
to additional costly anonymisation efforts. 
Civil society organisations argue that the data minimisation principle should become a 
cornerstone of any modern approach to data protection. Data controllers should think in terms 
of data minimisation at the very beginning of the design of products and services. Privacy 
organisations suggested that anonymisation could help to meet a principle of data 
minimisation. 
Improving the actual exercise of the rights of access, rectification, erasure or blocking of 
data  
Many citizens consider that they do not have enough control over their personal data put 
online. A number of respondents underlined specific dangers related to the publication of 
personal data (in particular pictures) by data subjects themselves - or the uploading by others 
of, inter alia, slanderous images and sensitive data – on social networking sites. They 
emphasised the necessity to harmonise and strenghen the right of access to personal data by 
decreasing the legal barriers, simplifying compulsory procedures and formalities, facilitating 
the determination of applicable law in cross-border cases and strenghening the role of DPAs. 
A number of other contributors, in particular businesses and public authorities, argued that 
rights of access, rectification and erasure or blocking are already part of the existing legal 
framework and advocated that further detailing of those rights in sectoral codes could be more 
appropriate, so that they can be better enforced in practice 
 
A group of academics noted the need to reconcile data subjects' right of access and the 
freedom of private communications, citing as an example the personal data restrictions of 
university email use. They also encouraged considering a limitation to the right of access to 
one's personal data based on the ground of disproportionate resource burden. 
 
EN 74   EN 
"Right to be forgotten" 
Several contributors stressed that the "right to be forgotten" and the existing right to delete 
one's own personal data are similar. Many stakeholders, especially technology companies, 
industry and trade alliances, service and content providers argued that the right to be forgotten 
is already explicitly guaranteed by the principles of purpose and use limitation and the right to 
erasure. These stakeholders therefore think that existing rules in this regard should be 
implemented better and their stronger harmonisation across the EU should be reached. 
Therefore, a clear distinction between the two rights would have to be made by defining clear 
requirements for the rights and specifying against whom the rights may be enforced. Most 
businesses also argued that the most fundamental challenge will be to define a "right to be 
forgotten" clearly, since it is not established or widely understood. 
 
Nevertheless, the right to be forgotten and the possibility to recuperate or delete personal data 
uploaded on internet websites was stressed as an absolute necessity by many citizens. They 
wished the legal framework to provide for such a possibility especially as regards under-age 
internet users.  
 
Industry alliances, service and content providers and legal and related 
companies argued that there should be exceptions to the right in some 
contexts and situations, such as preventing fraud or crime or for journalistic 
purposes. They were concerned that a right to be forgotten does not add 
value for businesses or customers and may cause industry to incur 
significant cost or administrative burdens. Service and content providers also 
noted that a right to be forgotten could negatively impact the services or 
products offered to customers. Some technology companies suggested that 
anonymisation can replace deletion as a means of protecting and enhancing 
this right.  
Service and content providers as well as international justice and trade organisations were 
also concerned that a right to be forgotten might conflict with other industry legal 
requirements to retain data for official legally sanctioned purposes. Stakeholders in the 
healthcare sector mentioned that they are sometimes obliged to keep patient data for a very 
long time, for example for the monitoring of undesirable effects of medicine.  
Some stakeholders highlighted that the right to be forgotten may also mean that consent 
should only be given for a reasonable and limited period, and that data should be deleted after 
the expiry of such period. Some stakeholders specifically suggested introducing a mechanism 
of automatic data deletion after the storage period ends. Some public authorities and DPAs 
fear that the right to be forgotten could have a very limited application in practice and ask for 
clarifications on the extent to which this right can be effective and on its costs. The EDPS 
suggested that the right to be forgotten might only be a solution in a digital environment.  
Civil society organisations supported the right to be forgotten. However, they 
also asked for clarification as to the meaning and principles associated with 
a right to be forgotten and that the right should be of substance rather than a 
slogan with no meaningful benefit to customers or industry. Privacy related 
organisations noted that alongside the right to be forgotten there is a need to 
 
EN 75   EN 
educate and raise awareness among data subjects that they have such a 
right which can be exercised. Consumer organisations noted that there is a 
need for such a right to be harmonised across the EU.  
Data portability 
A number of citizens have argued that they should be able to retain control over their personal 
data, including by moving it from one online application to another. Some stakeholders 
consider that data portability is redundant with the existing right of access. Others doubt its 
feasibility both in technical terms and as regards copyright and protection of intellectual 
property. Online service providers argued that user data should be clearly distinguished from 
data created by the service; in their view only user data could be portable. An alternative 
proposal was to introduce in the privacy notice mandatory information on what data can be 
retrieved from the online service and make this a voluntary practice. 
1.4. Raising awareness  
The Commission will explore: 
- the possibility for co-financing awareness-raising activities on data protection via the 
Union budget; 
- the need for and the opportunity of including in the legal framework an obligation to carry 
out awareness-raising activities in this area.  
Awareness-raising 
Some contributors indicated that the national DPA is the appropriate body to be tasked with 
awareness raising activities. Citizens in particular expect national DPAs to play a greater role 
in raising awareness of data protection norms amongst citizens and newly emerging data 
controllers who often have little knowledge of data protection compliance. 
There are diverging views on whether an obligation to carry out awareness-raising activities 
needs to be included in the legal framework. Some public authorities believe that Member 
States should take their own measures and DPAs should be allowed to choose their own 
approach. Some others note that awareness-raising is expensive and if this task is to be given 
to DPAs, it requires an explicit legal basis. Moreover, some DPAs suffer from insufficient 
funding in their Member State and welcomed any initiatives that would improve their 
financial situation. 
Some contributors argued that Data Protection should be a mandatory field of study in 
universities, for instance in fields of studies where the manipulation of sensitive data such as 
health data is inevitable.  
1.5. Ensuring informed and free consent 
The Commission will examine ways of clarifying and strengthening the rules on consent. 
 
There is a general consensus among public authorities, DPAs and EDPS on 
the need to clarify the notion of consent to avoid the risk of misinterpretation 
and to apply the rules uniformly and consistently across the EU. The specific 
 
EN 76   EN 
dimension of consent and the link to the purpose should be maintained. In 
their view, an opt-in approach is the most supportive of the right to privacy of 
data subjects vis-à-vis data controllers. Some DPAs expressed concern that 
always requiring explicit consent may be unworkable and present an undue 
burden on DPAs in ensuring sector-wide and industry compliance.  
A number of technology companies and industry alliances expressed support for a 
clarification of the definition and the rules around consent, but noted that the changes to 
consent should not negativelly impact business and industry. Several business stakeholders 
consider that consent may be implied from individuals' behaviour and note that requiring 
explicit consent in all circumstances could be detrimental to many business models and 
industry procedures. Some argue that a certain degree of flexibility as regards rules on 
consent is important in order to take into account certain business contexts (new business 
models, new technologies), social and cultural differences in understanding consent. Some 
contributors also highlight that privacy notices are not the best way to secure user's consent. A 
shared view among industry is that too much emphasis on consent will undermine privacy as 
individuals will become used to always agreeing to a stated purpose without necessairly 
understanding what is being asked of them 
Civil society organisations also supported an explicit, informed and opt-in 
approach to consent. However, some consumer organisations recognised 
that consent might be difficult to achieve and the need to explore the best 
possible way to ensure that consumers are aware of the consent they give. 
A need to raise awareness amongst consumers, and particularly children, 
about the consent and its implications in terms of their personal data was 
mentioned by many organisations. 
 
In addition, some citizens pointed out situations when the data subject is not in a position to 
give 'informed' and 'free' consent, such as a situation when the consent becomes part of a 
larger transaction or contract, "bundled" with a service sought by the customer, or the user is 
refused a service or charged a higher price unless he consents the processing of personal data 
or disclosure of such data to third parties. Some contributors proposed to oblige personal data 
controllers, whenever they intend to store or process personal data beyond the fulfilment of 
ordinary transactions, to explicitly specify those terms and conditions pertaining to consumer 
personal data and its compensation according to contract law, calling the result a "personal 
data contract". 
 
Citizens also mentioned the limited freedom to consent to personal data processing in the 
context of employment or unequal professional-consumer relations. 
 
Moreover, many citizens think that data subjects should be entitled to revoke their consent at 
any time and using online channels. The revocation should take effect immediately and not be 
circumvented by contract terms, refusal of services or higher price. Citizens also favoured 
opt-out by default from direct marketing services and placing the burden of proof on data 
controllers in opt-out cases. 
 
EN 77   EN 
 
1.6. Protecting sensitive data  
The Commission will consider: 
- whether other categories of data should be considered as ’sensitive data’, for example 
genetic data; 
- further clarifying and harmonising the conditions allowing for the processing of categories 
of sensitive data. 
There is a general consensus on harmonising the conditions related to the processing of 
sensitive data across the EU. Also many stakeholders support including genetic data in the list 
of sensitive data to be considered, especially pointing to the possible discriminatory use of 
genetic data. However, a big extension of the list is not favoured, several contributors 
preferring to stick with a short harmonised list of prohibited processing, allowing for some 
contextual exceptions. 
Some DPAs instead suggested putting more emphasis on the risk (e.g. significant damage or 
stress for individuals) that particular processing poses in particular circumstances while 
assessing sensitivity of personal data. Some public authorities highlighted that there is 
sometimes a need to process sensitive data, such as ethnic data in order to evaluate the 
benefits of some positive discrimination policies. Therefore exceptions need to be provided. 
The increase in biometric data is a common worry among citizens and respondents want it to 
be addressed in the new legal framework. One citizen underlined the lack of effective 
protection of health data in relation to new technologies in the health sector (e.g. ICT 
implants).  
A group of researchers noted that due to the broad definition of sensitive data many academic 
institutions are restricted in activities thay may carry out as the majority of social 
investigations involve the processing of such data. This practise may diminish academic 
freedom and result in loss of important forms of knowledge production. 
1.7. Making remedies and sanctions more effective 
The Commission will therefore: 
- consider the possibility of extending the power to bring an action before the national 
courts to data protection authorities and to civil society associations, as well as to other 
associations representing data subjects' interests;  
- assess the need for strengthening the existing provisions on sanctions, for example by 
explicitly including criminal sanctions in case of serious data protection violations, in order to 
make them more effective. 
Right to bring an action 
Some public authorities and citizens noted that present Directive offers limited help to 
individuals whose privacy has been violated and who need to obtain redress.  
 
EN 78   EN 
A fairly large number of citizens asked to introduce the right of action for consumer and 
privacy associations extending injunctions for the protection of consumers' interest to data 
protection violations. Collective redress mechanisms empowering groups of data subjects to 
combine their claims and bring a single action against data controllers are supported by the 
DPAs and the EDPS. As far as civil society associations are concerned, some contributors 
fear that 'class action' style of actions would increase the cost of services. 
Some businesses argued that out of court settlements and mediation by DPAs can be more 
efficient than judicial redress. 
Citizens emphasised the need to prohibit disadvantageous treatment of data subjects who 
exercise their rights under data protection legislation.  
– Powers of DPAs 
DPAs are in favor of strenghtening and harmonising their powers, an idea that is generally 
welcomed by citizens and privacy associations, whereas a number of business stakeholders 
argued that existing legislation gives sufficient powers to DPAs   
Sanctions 
Several public authorities considered that while administrative sanctions such as fines could 
be harmonised, they do not support the harmonisation of criminal sanctions as far as data 
protection is concerned. Others, however, argued that if the Commission considers the 
introduction of criminal sanctions, these should be a real deterrent to the unlawful trade in 
personal data and should be applied also against individuals who act maliciously. 
Some DPAs argued that the cost of reputational damage, is frequently higher than fines for 
companies. 
Citizens strongly supported a personal data security breach regime with strict accountability 
principles and corresponding remedies. Some underlined the accountability of manufacturers 
and proposed to introduce the liability for data safety in defective products as well as liability 
of data controllers for data protection breaches independently of their fault or negligence. 
Others supported the introduction of heavy criminal sanctions for systematic or reckless 
failure to meet the data protection requirements.  
 
According to some contributors the fines for data protection violations should be determined 
according to the scale and nature of the business of the data controller. Many citizens desired 
to see a fixed minimum compensation for victims of privacy violations established in the 
revised directive.  
  
 
EN 79   EN 
2. ENHANCING THE INTERNAL MARKET DIMENSION OF DATA PROTECTION 
2.1. Increasing legal certainty and providing a level playing field for data controllers 
The Commission will examine the means to achieve further harmonisation of data 
protection rules at EU level. 
Most citizens and many private stakeholders support further EU-level harmonisation of the 
data protection rules. Especially businesses operating in a number of Member States called for 
harmonised rules, which would simply their operations. Some business associations called for 
the mutual recognition of decisions by national DPAs. Some business argued that 
harmonisation can only be accepted if it does not lead to more stringent and burdensome 
rules. On the other hand, privacy associations argued that harmonisation and EU level should 
not lead to an overall reduction of data protection standards in the EU. 
According to one contributor the revised legislative act should be easier to understand and 
avoid excessively complex structure and terminology, as this may affect the implementation 
and help in gaining a wider public acceptance. 
2.2. Reducing the administrative burden 
The Commission will explore different possibilities for the simplification and 
harmonisation of the current notification system, including the possible drawing up of a 
uniform EU-wide registration form. 
Reducing the administrative burden is welcomed by most organisations and stakeholders, 
particularly businesses.  
Many DPAs see the existing notification system as administratively burdensome, requiring 
allocation of great resources for its administration and not accompanied by an equivalent 
improvement in data protection as notification are not necessarily useful for the DPAs' 
supervisory activities. Therefore, the majority of public authorities support either the 
elimination or simplification of the current notification procedure. One of the possible 
simplification options, proposed by some contributors, is to change the existing all-
encompassing general notification requirement to a more targeted system.  
One DPA noted that changes in the notification system could adversely impact the current 
fee-based funding model (i.e. not funded by their government but through notification fees 
paid by data controllers). The elimination of notification requirements is also strongly 
supported by a group of academics who perceive the existing system as entirely 
disproportionate and serving no useful purpose. 
However several companies indicated to the Commission that third party control and possibly 
certification (by the DPA or another independent organisation) is needed throughout the 'data 
processing lifecycle' (from the conception to the deployment, operations and later on 
dismantling) in order to guarantee a good level of privacy. They argued that self certification 
is ineffective, as many flaws in the data protection design may remain unnoticed.  
A comprehensive approach reviewing the notification of processing and the data breach 
notification would be welcomed by most stakeholders. Several stakeholders insist on the need 
 
EN 80   EN 
to fully harmonise and simplify notifications, and introduce the proposed EU-wide 
registration system. 
2.3. Clarifying the rules on applicable law and Member States' responsibility 
The Commission will examine how to revise and clarify the existing provisions on 
applicable law, including the current determining criteria, in order to improve legal certainty, 
clarify Member States' responsibility for applying data protection rules and ultimately provide 
for the same degree of protection of EU data subjects, regardless of the geographic location of 
the data controller. 
Some contributors proposed to improve the area of territorial application of the Directive, 
especially as regards multinational companies carrying out personal data processing in 
different Member States and companies established outside the EU but collecting personal 
data from EU citizens on a large scale. 
2.4. Enhancing data controllers' responsibility 
The Commission will examine the following elements to enhance data controllers' 
responsibility: 
 
– making the appointment of an independent Data Protection Officer mandatory and 
harmonising the rules related to their tasks and competences, while reflecting on the 
appropriate threshold to avoid undue administrative burdens, particularly on small and micro-
enterprises; 
– including in the legal framework an obligation for data controllers to carry out a data 
protection impact assessment in specific cases, for instance, when sensitive data are being 
processed, or when the type of processing otherwise involves specific risks, in particular 
when using specific technologies, mechanisms or procedures, including profiling or video 
surveillance; 
– further promoting the use of PETs and the possibilities for the concrete implementation of 
the concept of ‘Privacy by Design’. 
– Data Protection Officers (DPOs) 
There is overall support for introducing DPOs under certain threshold conditions among 
DPAs, public institutions and the EDPS. However, some DPAs noted the financial and 
administrative burden associated with mandatory DPOs and called for research to be 
conducted into this area seeking to minimise any negative impacts, especially on SMEs. Other 
DPAs noted that mandatory DPOs may not address the problems currently experienced in 
Europe due to a lack of expertise and skills as well as the specific nature of the problems. 
Industry organisations and companies in general preferred a voluntary and 
flexible DPO system as mandatory DPOs would impose a significant and 
unwarranted costs on some companies, particularly SMEs. While some 
service and content providers supported the use of DPOs perceiving them 
as key elements in order to demonstrate accountability, industry alliances 
 
EN 81   EN 
were concerned whether mandatory DPOs will be more effective than raising 
awareness and standards for data protection within organisational 
structures, procedures and operations. Several industry representatives, 
including service and content providers, doubt that internal DPOs can 
realistically be independent, given that, as employees of the company, they 
have to help it achieve its business goals. Some industry alliances also 
worried that requiring mandatory DPOs could be an unwarranted intrusion 
into internal company's operations and procedures. 
 
The majority of civil society organisations expressed the need for the role, 
duties, responsibilities and powers of DPOs to be harmonised across the EU 
as well as the mandatory requirement being consistently enforced within all 
Member States. Both consumer and privacy related organisations called for 
DPOs powers to be outlined, specifically to prevent DPOs from being limited 
to awareness raising and other education activities within organisations. 
 
– Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)  
Data protection impact assessments (DPIA) are seen as very useful tools to 
reinforce privacy and are supported by many contributors. DPAs supported 
the use of DPIAs as these might lead to greater self-regulation in terms of 
protecting privacy and data. Furthermore, DPAs suggested that the use of 
DPIAs might be incentivised for companies by foregoing other notification 
requirements where DPIAs have been conducted and their results made 
public. A few contributors however are not yet persuaded of the need to 
introduce a legal obligation for all data controllers to conduct data protection 
impact assessments, in the absence of a proper assessment of the 
subsequent benefits and additional burdens for data controllers and DPAs.  
Civil society organisations overwhelmingly supported the use of DPIAs. They 
introduced some specific recommendations, for example, DPIAs should be 
used where sensitive data is involved and when new databases are created. 
Many organisations also noted that mandatory DPIAs might represent undue 
burdens for some companies of smaller sizes, and that these difficulties 
should be taken into account. Consumer organisations argued that there is a 
need for DPIAs to be harmonised across the EU and standardised across 
business sectors.  
A number of responses across the industry, expressed concern about the 
costs associated with mandatory DPIA’s for business and industry, in 
particular SMEs. Many respondents preferred a voluntary or flexible DPIA 
system, which provides incentives and is encouraged by national DPAs. 
However, some respondents agreed that a mandatory DPIA might be 
appropriate in the case of sensitive data. Some industry respondents 
suggested that DPIAs should be considered in tandem with requirements for 
DPOs. 
– Privacy by design 
Many citizens support the introduction of the privacy by design principle.  
 
EN 82   EN 
DPAs also explicitly welcome the promotion of Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETS) and 
implementation of the concept of 'privacy by design', which could offer excellent prospects 
for strengthening accountability, security and individual rights. DPAs consider that the 
principle can be introduced without incurring any additional burden on the controller as such 
measures would focus on pre-establishing safeguards and mechanisms. Germany noted that 
privacy-by-design rules are already included in its legislation and argued that European 
privacy-by-design rules should not be too detailed to leave sufficient scope for different 
situations. 
Data protection institutions from the third countries also strongly support the Commission 
communication's approach on 'privacy by design' and consider 'privacy by design' a 
significant standard for data protection internationally which will foster simultaneous 
protection and innovation.  
By contrast, many stakeholders from the private sector consider privacy by design too vague a 
concept and difficult to measure if it has to remain technology neutral, whereas public 
administrations generally support it and see it as an approximation to OECD and APEC 
principles.  
Some stakeholders underline that they would agree to privacy by design, as long as it is not 
understood as 'privacy by default'. Some stakeholders suggested the creation of some check 
lists, in order to assess the level of accountability and privacy by design. These check lists 
could be made publicly available in a register. 
2.5. Encouraging self-regulatory initiatives and exploring EU certification schemes 
The Commission will: 
- examine means of further encouraging self-regulatory initiatives, including the active 
promotion of Codes of Conduct; 
- explore the feasibility of establishing EU certification schemes in the field of privacy and 
data protection. 
 
– Self-regulatory initiatives 
Many sectoral private organisations supported the development of self regulatory initiatives. 
The majority of DPAs referred to the need of encouraging self regulatory initiatives. Some 
mention that a self-regulation system should guarantee the representation of the sector, be 
credible and ensure that self-regulatory provisions are up to date and relevant. Internal control 
of compliance systems should be introduced, but it should not replace a possible inspection by 
a DPA or its sanctioning regime. 
– Certification schemes 
Certification schemes are widely supported by the industry, several industrial companies 
arguing that products that are awarded a seal should have a faster access to the market, and 
that some of the administrative burden should be lifted for those products. The 'Europrise' seal 
 
EN 83   EN 
is quoted as a good reference by several stakeholders. More than one citizen encourage to 
establish a European sign which could assure data subjects that data protection was carried 
out in accordance with the data protection standards. 
A few stakeholders argued that certification schemes should not be made mandatory, as this 
would create additional administrative burden. 
3. REVISING THE DATA PROTECTION RULES IN THE AREA OF POLICE AND JUDICIAL 
COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS 
The Commission will, in particular: 
- consider the extension of the application of the general data protection rules to the 
areas of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, including for processing at 
domestic level while providing, where necessary, for harmonised limitations to certain data 
protection rights of individuals, e.g., concerning the right of access or to the principle of 
transparency; 
- examine the need to introduce specific and harmonised provisions in the new general data 
protection framework, for example on data protection regarding the processing of genetic 
data for criminal law purposes or distinguishing the various categories of data subjects 
(witnesses; suspects etc) in the area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal 
matters; 
- launch, in 2011, a consultation of all concerned stakeholders about the best way to revise 
the current supervision systems in the area of police cooperation and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters, in order to ensure effective and consistent data protection 
supervision on all Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies; 
- assess the need to align, in the long term, the existing various sector specific rules 
adopted at EU level for police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters in specific 
instruments, with the new general legal data protection framework. 
 
There is general support among the DPAs and pubic institutions for extending data protection 
rules to the areas of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and for the 
harmonisation of any specific provisions considered necessary in this area. 
 
Law enforcement authorities should be subject to clear rules on the protection of personal data 
and they should be broadly comparable to the standards that apply in other sectors. However, 
as noted by several DPAs and national public authorities, special rules and derogations which 
duly take into account the specificity of the police and justice sector should be foreseen. Thus, 
specific needs of law enforcement authorities should be catered for within the legal 
framework (e.g. consent is unlikely to be readily forthcoming from those engaged in criminal 
activities). 
 
 
EN 84   EN 
As regards harmonised limitations on data protection rights of individuals, they have to be 
necessary, proportionate and not change the essential elements of the right itself. The EDPS 
emphasised that the Directive currently applies to "law enforcement" in various areas (such as 
taxation, customs, antifraud) that are not fundamentally different from many activities in the 
area of police and criminal justice.  
 
In Eurojust's view, the new instrument should defined the general principles applying to all 
sectors while specific provisions will still be applied to the area of police and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters. Given the specificity and sensitivity of the processing 
operations in this area, detailed tailor-made provisions would provide a higher level of 
protection than general ones. The exclusion of Eurojust and Europol from the scope of 
application of the Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on Data Protection should be 
maintained. 
 
Voices from industry seek clarifications on how organisations can disclose data without 
breaching data protection obligations where data are requested from international or national 
law enforcement authorities. Moreover, clarity is needed both on the applicable law and 
jurisdiction question as well as on the process of responding to requests received from law 
enforcement authorities. 
 
Some contributions argue that the EU should not introduce data protection safeguards that are 
so restrictive that they might stop law enforcement authorities from protecting the public. On 
the other hand, specific safeguards should be put in place in order to give data subjects 
additional protection in an area where the processing of personal data may be more intrusive. 
This is well ilustrated by citizens' replies who are worried about the amount of data collected 
by the police and law enforcement authorities and transfers of such data to third countries. 
 
4. THE GLOBAL DIMENSION OF DATA PROTECTION 
4.1. Clarifying and simplifying the rules for international data transfers 
The Commission intends to examine how: 
- to improve and streamline the current procedures for international data transfers, 
including legally binding instruments and ‘Binding Corporate Rules’ in order to ensure a 
more uniform and coherent EU approach vis-à-vis third countries and international 
organisations; 
- to clarify the Commission’s adequacy procedure and better specify the criteria and 
requirements for assessing the level of data protection in a third country or an international 
organisation; 
 
EN 85   EN 
- to define core EU data protection elements, which could be used for all types of 
international agreements. 
 
Respondents from all of the different types of industry organisations 
recommended increased harmonisation, consistent enforcement and 
uniform application of data protection rules. BCRs, notification requirements 
and other administrative burdens should be reduced in order to increase 
competitiveness of European companies, however these reductions in 
compliance burdens could be offset by the creation of new regulations. 
Despite the concerns about compliance costs, service and content providers 
and technology companies all recognised that strong data protection rules 
can increase consumer trust and provide a competitive advantage. 
Responses from international trade organisations also argued that a lack of 
harmonisation across Member States and globally disrupts business 
significantly and a harmonised approach would support competitiveness and 
benefit all businesses. 
 
Several companies, industry organisations and service and content 
providers all note that any changes to the directive should promote 
prosperity alongside privacy protection and recognise that restrictions and 
administrative burdens could give business operators based outside the EU 
serving customers in the EU an unfair advantage in not complying with the 
regulations applicable to EU companies. This is particularly true in relation to 
developing new technologies or services.  
 
Like industry, privacy related civil society organisations stated that the EU 
data protection framework should be considered in a global context and that 
the EU should take a lead in dialogue surrounding cross border data 
transfers. Privacy organisations also argued that sanctions should be 
imposed on organisations that move data processing across borders in order 
to avoid the burden or costs associated with compliance of EU legislation.  
 
– Adequacy  
Adequacy provisions are considered not satisfactory currently, as there is a need for 
clarification and streamlining. The current mechanisms are deemed to be bureaucratic, 
impractical, complex and not related to commercial realities. Cloud computing and the 
exponential growth in the use of the internet have moreover changed the nature and dynamics 
of international data transfers. 
The adequacy procedure as it is applied nowadays has been more a test of similarity or 
equivalence with the EU regime and has caused tensions with other countries whose 
enforcement mechanisms will naturally differ.  
According to the responses, the Commission should consider the possibility of granting 
sector-specific adequacy determinations, so that data of a certain type transferred to another 
country and subject to sector-specific laws or regulations may be found to be adequately 
protected. 
 
EN 86   EN 
Adequacy assessments must focus on the outcomes of the regime being analysed and not on 
the list of prescriptive provisions in the legal regime. The procedure should move from 
prescriptive rules to a risk-based model of accountability with adequacy of specific transfers 
rather than of a country in focus. More attention should be paid to the competence and 
adequacy of the body handling data rather than to the territory where data is held.  
A recurring industry view was that adequacy should be replaced by the extension of the 
accountability principle to international data transfers. This would place the emphasis on both 
data controllers and processors to ensure that data is adequately safeguarded regardless of 
location.  
The adequacy procedure should be more transparent so that businesses can anticipate 
favourable determinations and put in place appropriate arrangements in advance. One should 
also study the possibility of carrying out sectoral adequacies, for instance to cover certain part 
of a third country data protection regime (for instance, only the banking sector, or only the IT 
subcontracting sector, for countries that have sectoral legislation) 
According to industry, controllers (in the context of accountability) should have the flexibility 
to make their own adequacy determinations. The revised framework should include clear 
criteria for controllers to guide them through this process. 
In industry's view data processors should be reflected in the proposal – a processor that acts 
on behalf of a controller should not be treated as a third party (of course if a processor applies 
EU rules for data protection). As well, contractual options should allow transfers from data 
processors to sub-processors, provided that their obligations under the Directive are passed on 
in contract. 
Representatives of the academic community also supported a much more flexible approach 
and proposed to implement a risk-based model which would be built on data controller's 
obligation to evaluate all relevant factors (e.g. the nature of the data, how long the data will be 
in the third country, whether the data will remain under the control of the data controller etc.). 
In this case they accept that data transfer can take place even in situations where the general 
legal regime governing data protection is not similar to that as within the EU, but reasonably 
effective in protecting individuals’ core rights and interests. 
 
A citizen working in the IT field, proposed to introduce a certification scheme as a measure to 
comply with adequacy requirements in the context of international data transfers. 
Respondents argued that any international agreement between EU and a third country should 
reflect a high level of data protection. 
– Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)  
Respondents argued that the authorisation process for establishing BCRs is currently 
inefficient: too slow, bureaucratic and complex. Thus, a clearer, more harmonised approach to 
BCRs is needed and direct reference to BCRs should be made in EU legislation. Recognizing 
BCRs as a suitable way of providing appropriate protection measures will give BCRs a status 
equivalent to standard contractual clauses. However, BCRs should be better adapted to 
modern practices (e.g. cloud computing). 
 
EN 87   EN 
 
BCRs could easily serve as a more flexible and less formalistic approach to data transfers by 
means of robust internal policies and procedures and internal oversight and auditing.  They 
can constitute an alternative to adequacy. 
 
In respect of BCRs, the notions of both "accountability" and "group of companies" were 
referred to very often. BCRs provide a good framework for a variety of inter-group transfers 
for multinational companies. The prevailing opinion of the industry is that transfers within the 
same "group of companies" need to be radically simplified. They should also apply to data 
processors when transferring personal data (such expansion of scope would be beneficial to 
EU businesses). 
 
To make BCRs more attractive and effective, the mutual recognition scheme needs to be 
expanded to include all MS (for one single regulatory approval to have effect in EU-27). One 
stakeholder proposed a new approach to BCRs – creation of Binding Global Codes (BGCs) 
for multinational organisations built on foundation of accountability. They would take form of 
a set of binding rules demonstrating compliance with data protection principles on a 
worldwide basis. The Code would cover policies, procedures, technology and 
human/organisational issues, not just legal compliance, with clear governance arrangements 
and identifiable internal responsibility. 
 
4.2. Promoting universal principles 
The Commission will: 
- continue to promote the development of high legal and technical standards of data 
protection in third countries and at international level; 
- strive for the principle of reciprocity of protection in the international actions of the Union 
and in particular regarding the data subjects whose data are exported from the EU to third 
countries; 
- enhance its cooperation, to this end, with third countries and international 
organisations, such as the OECD, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and other 
regional organisations; 
- closely follow up the development of international technical standards by 
standardisation organisations such as CEN and ISO, to ensure that they usefully 
complement the legal rules and to ensure operational and effective implementation of the key 
data protection requirements. 
In the majority of contributions, the Commission was encouraged to continue its work on 
promoting development of international data protection standards. However this should not 
 
EN 88   EN 
take form of simply imposing EU standards on third countries. Constructive and open 
dialogue is required.  
Current revisions of the EU, Council of Europe, and OECD frameworks should lead to ensure 
greater convergence and enhanced protection for individuals. 
Modernisation of cross-border transfer of data between law enforcement authorities 
constitutes one of the areas where international standardisation could be beneficial. 
A global harmonised approach towards data protection is deemed indispensable especially 
bearing in mind the growing popularity of cloud computing services. Some stakeholders 
called for a multilateral binding agreement within the G8 or G20. 
There were several references, especially in contributions from the industry, to the Madrid 
resolution as a good step in establishing common standards. 
Some contributions called for capacity building support for third countries to promote the 
development of data protection standards. 
5. A STRONGER INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF 
DATA PROTECTION RULES 
The Commission will examine: 
- how to strengthen, clarify and harmonise the status and the powers of the national 
Data Protection Authorities in the new legal framework, including the full implementation 
of the concept of ‘complete independence’; 
- ways to improve the cooperation and coordination between Data Protection 
Authorities; 
- how to ensure a more consistent application of EU data protection rules across the internal 
market. This may include strengthening the role of national data protection supervisors, 
better coordinating their work via the Article 29 Working Party (which should become a 
more transparent body), and/or creating a mechanism for ensuring consistency in the 
internal market under the authority of the European Commission. 
 
The majority of views are that the coordination between DPAs should be enhanced in order to 
achieve a harmonised approach within the EU. Some emphasise that the role and competences 
of DPAs should be clarified and harmonised across the EU. Strengthening DPAs' powers 
should imply being able to bring actions before court and have the power to impose sanctions 
on controllers. 
Only few contributions suggested that there is no need for strengthening the DPAs as they 
have already sufficient powers. Instead the enforcement of provisions by them should be 
improved. 
 
 
EN 89   EN 
In addition, a wish for the enhanced cooperation not only between DPAs but also between 
DPAs and market regulatory authorities at Member States and EU level, for instance between 
the Art.29 WP and ENISA was expressed. The role of ENISA as far as data protection is 
concerned should also be clarified. 
 
As regards the full implementation of the concept of ‘complete independence’, the German 
Federal Government noted that Member States should be provided a way to reconcile the 
concept of ‘complete independence’ for data protection supervision with their constitutional 
traditions. On the other hand, the EDPS referred to the decision in Case C-518/07 and insisted 
on the need to clarify the notion of independence of DPAs and suggested to codify explicitly 
the elements of the 'absence of any external influence' and 'instructions from anybody' in the 
new legal instrument. 
 
The role of Art.29 WP in this respect in clarifying DP norms and standards is generally 
perceived as vital. Many respondents (especially from industry) argue that Art.29WP should 
be more engaged with stakeholders from public, private and NGO sector through 
consultations before it reaches the decision or publish an opinion. There are many calls for 
greater transparency of Art.29 WP activities. Some private stakeholders and organisations 
support a single point of contact at EU level. 
 
In order to make opinions of the Art.29 WP more authoritative the EDPS recommended to 
include an obligation for the DPAs and the Commission to take "utmost account" of opinions 
and common positions adopted by the Art.29 WP, based on the model adopted for the 
positions of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications in the 
Regulation No. 1211/2009. Furthermore, according to the EDPS proposal the new legal 
instrument could give the Art.29 WP the explicit task to adopt “interpretative 
recommendations”. 
 
The EDPS underlined a need to preserve and maybe improve coordination between the Art.29 
WP and the EDPS, to make sure that they work together on the main data protection issues, 
for instance by coordinating agendas on a regular basis and by ensuring transparency on 
issues which have a more national or specific EU aspect.

14. POLICY OPTION 1: SOFT ACTION  
14.1.1. 1.1. Problem 1: Barriers for business and public authorities due to fragmentation, 
legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement  
(see section 6.1.1, a) and c) of the Impact Assessment) 
1) Adoption of interpretative Communications by the Commission in order to clarify 
the existing rules 
The Commission would issue Communications to add more clarity on the interpretation of the 
provisions of the data protection instruments. While these Communications would not have a 
legally binding value, they would provide an authoritative and consistent interpretation of EU 
law, providing more clarity for both Member States and other stakeholders (data controllers, 
individuals) on key provisions of the Directive. However, the current practice with (non-
binding) Article 29 opinions on various aspects of the Directive has shown that the impact of 
such soft law on Member States' - and DPAs' – practice is quite limited. Furthermore, it needs 
to be taken into account that a Commission interpretation is not binding for the courts and that 
national courts and the ECJ in particular may come to different conclusions than the 
Commission. Therefore, interpretative Communications cannot sufficiently address the 
problem linked to the lack of legal certainty. 
2) Further encouraging self/co-regulation 
The Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Law Making of 2003 (IIA) between the 
Commission and the legislator provides for the use of self- and co-regulation as alternatives to 
EU legislation and lays down criteria and principles to apply regarding these instruments. The 
Data Protection Directive provides for self-regulation by explicitly encouraging the creation 
of codes of conduct and the assessment of their legal compliance and their endorsement by 
supervisory authorities at national level or by the Article 29 Working Party at EU level. This 
procedure incorporates elements of co-regulation within the meaning of the IIA. 
Since the entry into force of the Directive, the possibility to have codes endorsed by the 
Article 29 Working Party has been used in a very limited number of cases253. In a fast moving 
economic and technological environment, there could be an opportunity for self regulation to 
become a more meaningful and useful instrument, so that the encouragement for EU level self 
regulation should be assessed. In 2008, the Commission published a study on self regulation, 
which provided recommendations and a check list for self regulation initiatives based on a 
screening of 61 self- and co-regulation initiatives in SANCO policy areas254. 
                                                 
253  As an example, see the European Codes of practice for the use of Personal Data in direct marketing by 
FEDMA, including an annex on online direct marketing: http://www.fedma.org/index.php?id=56. It 
took several years to  have the annex to the Code finalised, due to discussions with the supervisory 
authorities and WP29 (see the opinions issued, one in 2003 and one in 2010): 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2010/wp174_en.pdf and
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2003/wp77_en.pdf). 
  
254 Self-Regulation Practices in SANCO Policy Areas, 
http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/self_regulation/docs/self-reg-SANCO-final.pdf 
 
EN 92   EN 
A successful self-regulation or co-regulation process is not necessarily of shorter duration 
than a legislative procedure. This is due to the fact that a meaningful agreement must achieve 
a balance of all relevant interests as must the ordinary legislative procedure, however, the 
actors in self-regulation are not subject to a similar mandate as the EU legislator and are not 
subject to similar time constraints and procedural deadlines. 
A self- or co-regulation procedure draws less on the resources of the institutions than a 
legislative initiative; it can be launched much faster than a legislative initiative, focus much 
more narrowly and provide much more precise rules than legislation, so that in the end it can 
make a considerable contribution to improving legal certainty for economic operators and 
more effectively protecting individuals' rights with respect to those activities and actors within 
its scope. It also may engage stakeholders more than the legislative procedure and may create 
a higher level of awareness due to their active participation in the process 
Effectiveness requires that such codes are monitored systematically and equipped with an 
enforcement mechanism which includes statutory enforcement of the underlying legislation as 
the last resort. 
Self regulation at EU level can only work properly when all participating actors have a 
common legal basis. Divergences in implementation and application of legal provisions 
between Member States make EU level codes of conduct unworkable or reduce their scope 
considerably. National level self regulation can only have limited effect for the EU Single 
Market as they cannot address cross-border issues; and in some cases it could contribute to 
making cross-border activities more difficult when national codes differ in substance. 
Stronger harmonisation of legal implementation and application of data protection rules may 
therefore be the key factor to increase the effect of self-regulation and lead to a broader use of 
this instrument in the data protection domain, but self regulation cannot address the lack of 
harmonisation itself. 
All in all, self-regulation at EU level, if it is accepted by all stakeholders and recognized by 
the competent authorities, may increase legal certainty and practical harmonisation for all 
stakeholders, but it can achieve this effect only when a clear and harmonised legal framework 
serves as a basis. It cannot, by itself, overcome fragmentation of national transposition, as 
evidenced by the current situation. 
3) Standardisation 
Standards developed by recognized standardisation bodies and addressing technological and 
organisational aspects of data protection could provide practical guidance for data controllers 
on setting up data protection compliant practices in their organisations. The well developed 
system of security standards and existing sectoral standards for privacy demonstrate the 
feasibility and the benefits of this approach. The standardisation process allows for the 
involvement of all relevant stakeholders and participation of DPAs, so that a broad reflection 
of all relevant views can be expected. 
Nevertheless, successful EU level standardisation requires that legal requirements are clear 
and consistent. Standardisation cannot solve by itself obstacles created by divergent 
requirements in Member States. 
 
 
EN 93   EN 
 
4) Interpretative Clarification regarding DPA powers, resources and independence 
Considerable divergences exist with respect to the powers actually entrusted to DPAs for 
investigation and intervention, as well as their available resources. The Commission could 
spell out in more detail the requirements resulting from the current framework. Independence 
of DPAs is already enshrined in the current Directive and the recent ECJ case-law on the 
matter (case C-518/07) has clarified the requirements to ensure full independence. The 
strengthening of DPAs independence would allow them to better play their role in supervising 
data protection legislation at national level, and decide autonomously their enforcement 
priorities. A Communication could outline the Commission's plans on how to ensure that all 
Member States comply with the Court's findings on independence and a time schedule. 
As regards independence, the legal conditions have been clarified by the Court and provide 
the Commission with a basis to assess DPA independence in all Member States and use its 
instruments to ensure full compliance of all Member States. More concrete information would 
help the Member States to prepare any adjustments of their national laws where necessary. 
As regards DPA powers and resources, an interpretative Communication by the Commission 
is not likely to have strong effect on national transposition legislation. Member States 
generally consider it necessary to adapt enforcement and monitoring systems to the overall 
structure of their legal, administrative and enforcement environment where no precise binding 
rules are provided by the Union acquis. Commission advice regarding resources allocated to 
DPAs may not have strong effect, given budgetary constraints in many Member States. 
5) Strengthened coordination tasks for WP29 vis-à-vis national DPAs and tools 
Under this option, the catalogue of tasks of the WP29 would be extended to include the 
provision of advice to national DPAs and the exchange and preparation of best practices. 
DPAs would have additional practical IT tools, to improve the exchange of information, 
cooperation and mutual assistance between them. This, together with the strengthened role of 
WP29 in providing advice to DPAs and the encouragement of staff exchanges between DPAs, 
shoulc help the development of more consistent enforcement practices across the EU. This 
would be beneficial to businesses, in particular, but also to individuals. 
The cost of three concrete elements supporting this enhanced co-operation are assessed 
below: 
• The cost of setting an IT system for collaboration have been estimated to be up to 
€ 2 million one off costs255, plus annual running costs of € 300 000 and additional costs in 
terms of human resources. The system would allow the secure exchange of documents 
between DPAs, and include a workflow to follow up that documents are reviewed and 
validated in due time if required for the cooperation procedures. Before setting up such a 
system, an in-depth analysis of the reusability of existing systems would need to be made, 
in order to minimize both initial and running costs; 
                                                 
255  Based on the costs of other information exchange systems developed by DG JUST, such as the e-Justice 
portal. 
 
EN 94   EN 
• A budget for a programme supporting exchange of experts between DPAs, in order for 
them to work better in a network and to reinforce cooperation should also be provided. 
Depending on the number of participants, it can be estimated empirically that between € 
500,000 and € 1 million per year could be devoted to an exchange program between DPAs 
(covering training, travel expenses and daily allowances of staff working in another DPA 
than his own). 
• The Secretariat of the Art. 29 WP would need to be reinforced to cover the additional 
work. A 30% increase of the Secretariat budget to cover the additional workload could be 
estimated; based on current costs for the workload of Art 29 WP, this would amount to 
about € 0.5million.  
6) Harmonised notifications forms – Single (online) platform 
The setting up of a central platform with an online form, whereby data controllers submit only 
one form and mark the countries they need to notify – as one of the options proposed by the 
WP29 in its Advice paper on the matter256 – would help reducing and simplifying the 
administrative formalities and burden linked to notifications. This would be welcome by 
Member States, as they could keep their current – differentiated – regime for notifications and 
exceptions/derogations. On the other hand, this option presents several shortcomings. 
The setting up of such a platform – be it by the Commission or by one or several DPAs - 
would be technically complex and costly, given the need to take account of the different 
requirements of the various Member States. For reference, the Commission has the experience 
of setting up information systems which provide for exchange of information between public 
authorities; such systems include IMI (internal market information system), Eurodac, the SIS 
system (information about wanted persons), the CPCS system, and the e-justice portal 
(information about the judicial system). Costs and implementation times of the systems vary 
greatly (time to set up from 18 months to several years, and costs from € 1 million to 
multiples of € 10s of millions, depending on the number of authorities involved, and the 
volume and complexity of the data). Experience shows that the complexity and cost of setting 
up such a system grows especially when the national laws defining how to collect and process 
the data in the Member states are not sufficiently harmonised, which would be the case in 
policy option 1. 
The added value of such considerable investment would be limited as it would only reduce 
part of the burden – i.e., it would reduce the paper formalities by providing a unique and 
centralised electronic interface – while leaving the current differences in substantial 
requirements and the related costs unaffected. This solution is unlikely to be perceived by 
stakeholders as reducing sufficiently the costs and the administrative burden linked to 
notification requirements. 
7) Legal amendments clarifying provisions on international transfers 
Clarifying and detailing the criteria for adequacy and providing a clear legal basis for Binding 
Corporate Rules (BCRs) – which have developed as a matter of practice, thanks to the input

EN 95   EN 
of WP29 - would bring more legal certainty as regards international transfers and would 
benefit data controllers and individuals as well as the third countries concerned. However, this 
would not address all issues raised by business stakeholders about the limits of the current 
BCRs model, i.e. on the length and complexity of the procedure, which often requires several 
authorisations at national level even when the BCR has been validated by the "lead" DPA.  
14.1.2. 1.2. Problem 2: Difficulties for individuals to stay in control of their personal data   
(see section 6.1.1, b) and c) of the Impact Assessment) 
8) Awareness-raising activities (information to individuals, particularly children) 
The Fundamental Rights and Citizenship programme will continue to fund awareness-raising 
activities related to data protection, targeting children in particular. Current funding (about 
€ 800 000 for the period of 2009-2010 under the Fundamental Rights Programme) could be 
increased by 25% in order to expand such activities further. 
9) Promotion of PETs, privacy-friendly default settings, uptake of privacy seals 
The EU already promotes and supports the research and development of privacy enhancing 
technologies, privacy by design and privacy by default settings through research priorities in 
FP 7. More than 13 EU projects related to privacy enabling technologies are currently funded 
by the EU budget. An additional call for projects related to security and privacy has been 
published in July 2011 with a budget of € 80M257. Some additional funding for studies under 
the Fundamental Rights Programme could be envisaged to promote specific objectives, such 
as an "EU privacy seals for international transfers".  
These measures would provide support to increased application of the principle of "Privacy 
by Design" in the industry. As a recent survey carried out by the Commission has shown258, 
privacy by design is favoured by a large majority of the security industry who believes that it 
should be a mandatory obligation, 77% of the respondents from the industry would even 
favour introducing the privacy by design principle in the legislation. As regards sector 
specific trust marks and seals, they are generally viewed favourably by industry, but would 
not welcome a horizontal certification program. 
Continuing and strengthening current support through EU programmes will maintain the 
current level of engagement of stakeholders, mainly in research and technological 
development. However, as the experience from several years of this support shows, it does 
not create an incentive for broad endorsement in business practices when rolling out new 
commercial or public services. 
10) Introduction of explicit transparency and data minimisation principles 
The introduction of an explicitly stated transparency principle for the controller - while not 
adding specific additional obligations - would build on the existing provisions to provide the 
necessary information to the individuals concerned before the processing of their personal 
data not only in specific cases, but extend this to processing in general. This would strengthen 
                                                 
257  FP 7, call 8, Objective ICT-2011.1.4 Trustworthy ICT 
258  Survey conducted in Q1 2011 by DG ENTR with companies representative from the security industry. 
 
EN 96   EN 
the data subjects position as this would enable him/her to have more and earlier insights into 
the processing of his or her personal data provided by the controller in the specific case and 
lay the foundation for his or her consent (if and where necessary). 
It would equally strengthen the data controller in relation to the data subject as he would 
demonstrate upfront to the data subject his way of processing the personal data in question 
and thereby generate the necessary trust. While the implementation by controllers may 
generate some initial additional costs, these would be offset by the potential benefits for the 
controller controlling data flows and for the development of e-commerce.  
Data minimisation, i.e. processing and storing only those personal data that are necessary for 
a legitimate purpose, is becoming more and more important when technical limitations to 
storage, processing and transfer capacity are quickly disappearing, and when at the same time 
security risks and data breaches are becoming more prevalent. Security and data protection 
experts have underlined that data that is not stored or processed cannot be misused as a 
consequence of a breach. The principle is already provided for by the current provisions; 
however, it is not always fully understood how to interpret in practice. An explicit explanation 
of the principle in the legal instrument will provide data controllers with more clarity and 
improve the protection of individuals; and it will have no effect on legitimate data processing. 
It would strengthen the existing provisions on data quality, explicitly stressing that data 
processed should be limited to the minimum necessary in relation to the purposes for which 
they are collected and/or further processed. 
Explicit recognition of the principle would be beneficial to data subjects as they will not be 
exposed to excessive data collection, which will better ensure their protection. Also this will 
limit the negative impact of data collected while not necessary (e.g., function creep, 
reputational risk, aggressive marketing and surveillance). As regards the impact on data 
controllers, data minimization requires full understanding of the data one possesses in order to 
be able to delete with confidence. Data minimisation is a sound principle of data management. 
It helps avoiding data overflow and mitigates the risks in case of security breaches. Moreover, 
data loses its value over time, and it would reduce costs associated with the use of outdated 
data and increase compliance with data quality requirements. Finally, if data subjects do not 
feel that their data protection right is violated by excessive collection of data, e.g. for online 
services, consumer trust will increase, thereby potentially having a positive effect on the 
development of e-commerce. 
14.1.3. 2. POLICY OPTION 2 - MODERNISED LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
14.1.4. 2.1 PROBLEM 1 - Barriers for business and public authorities due to 
fragmentation, legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement 
(see section 6.1.2 of the Impact Assessment) 
1) Further harmonising the substantive data protection rules  
This would be achieved by a combination of measures, namely: 
a) Clearer and more detailed substantive provisions    
 
EN 97   EN 
More precise and detailed rules would harmonise the implementation and application in 
Member States, thus greatly reducing the current cost of legal fragmentation (estimated to 
amount – only in terms of administrative burden – to almost € 3 billion per annum). These 
costs are incurred by economic operators processing personal data several Member States to 
which different national rules are applicable.  
Replacing the current Directive by a Regulation or by a maximum harmonisation Directive 
– together with a clarification of rules on applicable law and other simplification measures 
(see below) - would have the effect of eliminating most, if not all, of these costs and 
drastically simplifying the regulatory environment. The resulting economic benefits for the 
internal market would be considerable as: 
• In the short run, economic operators would no longer be faced with the disincentive 
of high legal costs when considering whether to expand their business cross-border. 
The enhanced legal certainty could therefore encourage greater cross-border 
investment within the internal market and also boost the competitiveness of EU 
economic operators internationally. 
• In the medium-run, more cross-border offers in the internal market would boost 
competition within the Member States, increase consumer choice, and hence put a 
downward pressure on prices. 
• In the long-run, savings in legal costs may result in more funds being devoted by 
economic operators to research and development, hence boosting innovation in the 
internal market 
• Also in the long-run, the streamlined regulatory environment with one set of clear 
and consistent rules applying across the internal market would make the EU a more 
attractive place for business, for multinational companies considering expansion into 
the EU.  
This approach – and particularly the Regulation option, being directly applicable upon 
Member States without the need for transposition into different national laws - is strongly 
supported by the great majority of economic operators, which consider it essential to ensure 
the desired legal certainty and simplification within the internal market. On the other side, a 
Regulation would have an important impact on Member States, given the fact that most of 
them have developed an extensive and detailed national legislation implementing the 
Directive, covering both the private and the public sector.  
Additionally, entrusting the Commission with powers to adopt implementing measures or 
delegated acts in specific cases would increase consistency of the EU data protection 
framework. In particular, detailed harmonised rules could be adopted for specifying technical 
aspects that require uniform conditions of implementation (e.g. detailed security measures in 
various situations). 
The implementing powers to be given by the legislator to the Commission would follow the 
rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the European Parliament 
 
EN 98   EN 
and the Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing and powers259, thereby 
guaranteeing for a procedural involvement, whilst leaving the possibility for the European 
Parliament or the Council to be able at any time to indicate to the Commission that, in its 
view, a draft implementing act exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the basic act, 
taking into account their rights relating to the review of the legality of Union acts. 
2) Revising the rules on applicable law and on DPA competence (one single law and 
"one-stop-shop") 
In case of a Directive, the applicable law would be the law of the Member State of main 
establishment of the controller. In case of a Regulation, the EU legal instrument would be the 
single and directly applicable law across EU Member States. 
In both cases, the clarification and simplification of rules and criteria on applicable law, 
would be highly beneficial to data controllers with several establishments in the EU, as it 
would remove conflicts of application, provide more legal certainty and reduce existing 
unnecessary costs since the controller would shift from a distributive application of different 
national laws to a centralised application of a single legislation in all Member States260.  
In addition to the single applicable law, the fact of entrusting one single DPA with the 
competence to deal with a controller operating across the EU would respond to the strong 
demands for simplification and consistency of the current enforcement system, leading to a 
"one-stop-shop" for data controllers and processors. Together with the increased substantive 
harmonisation of the rules and the simplification of rules on applicable law, this would 
contribute to reducing the costs linked to fragmentation. Due to the much higher degree of 
harmonisation of the data protection rules the effective application of the “main 
establishment” principle – both for the applicable law (if it is a Directive) and for DPA 
competence - would not result in ‘forum shopping’ in favour of Member States whose 
legislation would be considered as less strict in terms of data protection requirements. 
From the point of view of the data subject, the impact would bring about equally legal 
certainty as to what rules apply to the processing of his or her personal data. And in any case, 
the data subject would retain the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority 
of his/her choice (e.g. his/her residence). Strengthened administrative sanctions available to 
DPAs against non-compliant data controllers will contribute to ensure that individuals' rights 
are actually respected and enforced.  
3) Replacing notifications with a generalised basic registration system 
A basic registration for all data controllers would simplify formalities and allow certain DPAs 
to continue financing themselves with a fee-based system261. However, if the registration 
                                                 
259  Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the 
rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of 
implementing powers, OJ L 055 , 28/02/2011 P. 013 – 018. 
260  Within the territory of the EU the need for more precision in the legal framework and a simplified criterion to 
determine the law applicable has been emphasised by the Article 29 Working Party in a recent opinion (Opinion 
8/2010 on applicable law, WP 179). 
261  This concerns, in particular, the UK DPA (ICO), which is currently exclusively funded by notification fees. ICO 
argues that a fee-based funding model is the application of the ‘polluter pays’ principle (in that those processing 
personal data are the ones who make it necessary for there to be a system of supervision, regulation and advice and 
guidance services provided by data protection authorities, and they therefore are the ones who should pay for it). 
 
EN 99   EN 
system would be a general requirement and not allow for derogations of the same level as the 
current notification rules, it would impose additional – albeit - reduced administrative burden 
to data controllers in those Member States that have made extensive use of the current 
possibilities for exemptions and derogations (e.g. Sweden, Germany). On the other hand, 
maintaining this kind of margin would again open the possibility of divergence in Member 
States, contrary to the main policy objective pursued (i.e. simplification and reduction of 
undue administrative burden). 
However, it would fall short of the expectations of the large majority of economic 
stakeholders for which this represents an (unnecessary) administrative burden, without 
providing any actual added value for the data subject. Indeed, DPAs themselves 
acknowledged that the current register – available at DPAs premises on the basis of 
notifications received - "is no longer the best and more appropriate way for individuals to 
understand what an organisation is doing with their personal data, and who to contact when 
things go wrong"262.  
If this system is estimated to cost 50% of the current costs of notifications to DPAs (including 
the additional burden in those Member States that largely exempt from notifications today), 
then it can be assumed that its overall cost would amount to approximately €65 million per 
annum across the EU.  
4) Notification of data breaches to DPAs and individuals  
Technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing of personal 
data, appropriate to the risk connected to the processing and taking account of the state of the 
art and the cost of the measure, are already a legal obligation for data controllers under 
existing legislation, Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC. Systematic monitoring 
and enforcement of these obligations is, however, difficult, as it would require a thorough 
assessment of internal conditions and procedures of the data controller by the enforcement 
authority. In practice, inadequate security measures are only discovered in cases where 
breaches of security occur and come to the knowledge of the authorities of the public. 
In some jurisdictions, obligations to notify security breaches which compromise personal data 
have been introduced. Experience has shown that these obligations have indeed a positive 
effect on data security measures taken by data controllers. This is due to a number of reasons: 
breach notifications provide a systematic feedback about the actual risk and the actual 
weaknesses of existing security measures; they enable authorities and consumers to assess the 
relative capabilities of data controllers with respect to data security; they force data controllers 
to assess and understand their own situation regarding security measures. Data security issues 
become relevant for the management level of an organisation, which may be even further 
encouraged to apply systematic procedures by the objective to avoid reputational damage in 
the case of an avoidable breach. 
Member State legislators and administrations have started to implement notification 
obligations for data breaches. In order to avoid diverging Member State rules, the Union has 
to provide for a harmonised system of breach notifications across the EU. As a first step, a 
breach notification obligation was introduced with the review of the electronic 
communications framework in the e-Privacy Directive. As requested by the European 
                                                 
262  See Advice Paper of WP29 on notifications, p.6. 
 
EN 100   EN 
Parliament, the current review of the general data protection framework is now the 
opportunity to create an all encompassing obligation to notify personal data breaches. 
Under the e-Privacy Directive, all personal data breaches occurring at providers of electronic 
communications services have to be notified to the competent national authority. In addition, 
breaches that are likely to adversely affect the privacy or personal data of individuals are to be 
notified to these individuals concerned. A recital of the amending Directive lists cases that are 
considered examples for creating adverse effects, i.e. if the breach may lead to identity theft 
or fraud, physical harm, significant humiliation or damage to reputation. The Directive 
empowers the Commission to adopt implementing measures on the circumstances, format and 
procedures of breach notifications in a comitology procedure, including stakeholder 
involvement and consultation of ENISA, the EDPS and the Article 29 Working Party. 
US experience – as well as the responses from stakeholders – suggests that the definition of 
the threshold for notification to the data subjects is a key factor to determine the immediate 
cost impact of breach notification obligations on data controllers, including the administrative 
burden. The proper setting of this threshold is also necessary to achieve the intended effect on 
improving the protection of individuals with regard to possible misuse of their personal data. 
If the criteria are set too strict and the threshold too high, data subjects may not be informed 
about breaches concerning their data and may lose the opportunity to protect themselves 
against damaging consequences. If the threshold is set too low and criteria are too lose, data 
subjects might receive many notifications that do not actually require any action from their 
side. This could lead to a so-called notification fatigue, with the result that data subjects do 
not pay attention to notifications and miss cases that would require action on their part. 
This is why following the same approach as in the e-Privacy Directive - i.e. defining the core 
elements of the notification system and leaving the definition of details on circumstances 
(including criteria to assess the likelihood of adverse effects), procedures and formats to 
Commission implementing measures, appears as the best solution to ensure consistency 
across sectors. When the amendments of the ePrivacy Directive were discussed, the EU 
legislator chose this approach as it found that the use of implementing measures allowed more 
detailed, precise and flexible rules than could be integrated in the basic legal act itself. These 
considerations were conducted with a broader application than the electronic communications 
sector in mind, as the legislator also noticed that data breaches in some other areas, in 
particular online business, could result in similar or even more serious damage than in that 
sector. An additional advantage of technical implementing measures would be that they 
would allow for differentiation of sectors where appropriate, what would not be possible 
within the sector agnostic general data protection instrument. Implementing measures would 
allow for a comparably fast and easy way to adjust rules based on experience with first 
practical application of breach notification rules in the EU and to ensure that its practical 
application can remain in line with technological development.  
Notably, the experiences with breach notifications in the electronic communications sector 
could be fully exploited for a more general solution. It results that the approach of leaving the 
definition of details regarding circumstances, formats and procedures of notifications to 
implementing measures is more effective regarding the achievement of the political objectives 
of simplification and improving individuals' exercise of their rights that the attempt to provide 
for full details in the basic act. The approach also allows for better involvement of 
stakeholders and better balancing of the different interests at stake. 
 
EN 101   EN 
While the legal instrument should provide for the possibility of defining details of breach 
notifications through implementing measures, it must set certain basic characteristics of the 
procedures by itself. It has been suggested in particular that setting a more precise time frame 
for a notification could provide more legal clarity to data controllers and reassure data 
subjects. While the ePrivacy Directive provides that notifications should be made without 
undue delay, a 24-hour deadline to notify the supervisory authority, where feasible, , from the 
establishment of the breach and the identification of who is affected s could be expected to 
provide more precision.  
The impact of such a concrete deadline needs to be assessed. Firstly, it needs to be clarified 
which event should trigger the start of the time interval. Such an event would be the detection 
of the breach by the data controller. To be more precise, it would be the moment when the 
data controller records in its files that an event that triggered a first investigation has been 
identified as a personal data breach. This event could be a security breach discovered in-
house, or an alert received from an outside entity. It should be noted that the actual breach 
itself may have taken place much earlier, or may have been ongoing for a while before it was 
detected. Secondly, it should be considered that a notification is the more useful the more 
precise and comprehensive information about the nature of the breach and the data concerned 
can be provided. A 'quick and dirty' notification rushed out to meet a deadline, which then 
requires updates and corrections will cause more insecurity concern and loss of confidence of 
data subjects than it provides benefits to users. Thirdly, the notification can only be provided 
if the individuals concerned and a workable channel for the communication of the notification 
have been identified. Fourthly, as already recognized by the amended ePrivacy Directive, the 
breach may require additional criminal and forensic investigations which could be 
compromised if the general public, including the perpetrators, receives early information 
about the detection of the breach. Any deadline for notifying a breach must in practice 
consider these elements and should not create an incentive for the data controller to delay the 
recognition and recording of a breach in order to avoid consequences of a formally delayed 
notification.  
Nevertheless, the legal instrument could provide the clarification that a first notification of the 
detection of a personal data breach should be delivered to the competent authority, where 
feasible, within 24 hours after the establishment of the breach, followed where appropriate by 
more detailed information as it becomes available. The data controller shall provide the 
competent authority on its request with the precise reasons if the delay exceeds 24 hours. 
Individuals would only be notified, without undue delay, where the data breach is likely to 
adversely affect the protection of the personal data or privacy of the data subject. This would 
ensure that "over-notification" – even when there is no harm to the individual - is avoided. As 
regards criteria for determining the seriousness of a breach, it should be taken into account 
that quantification is generally not possible due to the vast differences of breach cases that can 
occur. The number of individuals concerned by a breach cannot be used as a severity 
criterion, as the possible risk for any individual is not dependent from the number of others 
that are concerned by the same incident. In some circumstances damage may even be ore 
likely when less individuals are concerned, e.g. if a hacker obtains only a few credit card 
records, each one may have a much higher probability to be used for fraud than when several 
million records are stolen. 
Annex 9 estimates the cost of this measure in terms of administrative burden to amount to € 
20 million per annum, based on UK figures and extrapolating from those for the rest of the 
EU, factoring in a cost of € 400 per notification. 
 
EN 102   EN 
5) Strengthened and simplified rules on international transfers 
Simplifying the rules on international transfers would generally have a positive impact both 
on relations with third countries and on non-EU businesses and will boost the competitiveness 
of EU economic operators internationally, as they will find it easier to transfer personal data 
outside of the EU. In particular (in addition to measures foreseen in Policy Option 1, see 
above): 
• Giving the Commission a monopoly on adequacy findings would reduce uncertainty and 
inconsistency that would arise from potentially contradictory decisions from Member 
States, which are both prejudicial to data controllers; 
• Abolishing the system of prior authorisations in Member States when standard tools (e.g. 
contractual clauses or BCRs) are used, would also be beneficial to data controllers as it 
would shorten and simplify the procedure for authorising a transfer, thus reducing costs; 
• Extending the use of BCRs to "data processors and "groups of undertakings", together 
with the simplification of the procedure of "mutual recognition" between DPAs, would 
extend and facilitate their use, while at the same time ensuring a high level of data 
protection. This would considerably reduce the time (currently 6 months to 2 years) and 
the money spent on – nowadays - long and burdensome procedures (up to € 1 million for 
large companies as reported in the course of the public consultation by some of these 
companies with BCR experience).  
• Allowing data controllers, under certain circumstances, to conduct their own assessment 
under their responsibility - and adducing appropriate safeguards - as regards specific 
transfers will increase flexibility. 
6) New governance system – Better monitoring and enforcement 
a) Strengthening national DPAs  
The strengthening of DPAs independence would be highly beneficial to data subjects, as it 
would help them exercise their data protection rights: DPAs would have more powers and 
resources to investigate complaints, assist individuals in having access to their data etc. Data 
controllers are also likely to benefit since DPAs will have more resources to provide advice 
and assistance to them.  
The harmonisation of tasks and powers of DPAs is essential to ensure that they can 
effectively perform their monitoring and investigation tasks, as well as for the proper working 
of the cooperation and consistency mechanism described below. 
As regards costs, the requirement of providing DPAs with sufficient resources to be able to 
fulfil their tasks would require additional financial means for some Member States. This 
additional cost is difficult to estimate in general, given the current differences in the size, 
available resources, means of funding, tasks and powers of national DPAs. It is likely that the 
costs will be higher for smaller Member States and/or those Member States where DPAs have 
limited resources at the moment, taking into account that the abolition of notification 
requirements will freed resources. 
 
EN 103   EN 
Ensuring proper resources for DPAs is also key to ensure good cooperation between them. 
Some DPAs face recurrent financial difficulties, limiting their ability to cooperate with others.  
b) Strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance between DPAs –Mutual recognition of 
decision and "consistency mechanism" 
Together with the revision of provisions on applicable law (see above), these measures would 
further enhance the internal market dimension of data protection, increase harmonisation 
and legal certainty and reduce the current costs linked to fragmentation and inconsistent 
enforcement.   
As regards the impact on Member States’ data protection authorities, they will no longer have 
a direct role in cases where the data controller's main establishment would be in another 
Member States and thus outside their direct supervision. However, they would remain 
competent to supervise the implementation of the data protection legislation on the territory of 
their Member State e.g. to verify and intervene on a processing operation that is taking place 
on its territory by a controller with a main establishment in another Member State. This would 
have to be done in close coordination with the supervisory authority in that Member State, 
which would take a final decision against the controller. This decision would have to be 
enforced by all concerned DPAs on their own territory. 
The new cooperation and consistency mechanism between DPAs will ensure that their 
concerns are taken into account as they would be able to intervene in cases concerning their 
citizens and or affecting their country. The strengthened role of the Commission would ensure 
the overall consistency and compliance with EU rules on data protection.  
This mechanism would also entail additional costs (including administrative burden) for: 
• National DPAs, as they would need to foresee additional resources to adequately 
cooperate and exchange information with other DPAs, in particular to: 
• Carry out checks, inspections and investigations as a result of requests from DPAs 
in other Member States, as part of the mutual assistance mechanism established; 
• Have additional staff and mechanisms in place to investigate enforcement requests 
from DPAs in other Member States; 
• enforcement of the decisions taken by DPAs in other Member States as part of the 
"one-stop shop" system of supervision 
It is expected that DPAs will need at minimum 2 or 3 staff members working for the 
EU cooperation to ensure a proper functioning of the proposed consistency mechanism. 
This may pose problems for the DPAs of small Member States, whose financial and 
human resources are already more scarce. On the other hand there is a trade-off, as 
parallel procedures by several DPAs will be eliminated by the clear assignment of a 
single DPA for the controller. It is difficult to establish the balance between these 
effects as this will depend very much on the current size and resources of DPAs, the 
cases they will have to be involved in etc. 
• The EU budget, since additional human, financial and technical resources should be 
foreseen to:  
 
EN 104   EN 
a) Handle notifications of cases handled by DPA that have a European impact.  In other 
policy areas similar mechanisms (e.g. telecom, technical standards), require between 
15 and 20 staff to handle the notification system managed by the Commission, 
together with adequate technical means (databases, communication system, 
translations etc). The data protection consistency mechanism requires resources 
particularly from the EDPS, which will provide the secretariat of the European Data 
Protection Board and operate the IT system required for quick and standardised 
communication between national DPAs and the Board. Together with the general 
tasks of the board secretariat, these tasks will require 10 FTE posts (in addition to the 
EDPB Chair).  Overall, the EDPS budget will have to be increased by approximately € 
3 million on average for the first six years of operation. 
b) Establish an information exchange system to facilitate communication between DPAs, 
the Commission and the European Data Protection Board which will be replacing 
the WP29. 
(see section 6.1.2, b) of the Impact Assessment) 
14.1.5. 2.2. Problem 2: Difficulties for individuals to stay in control of their personal data   
7) Clarifying substantive rules  and key concepts 
a) Definition of personal data (online identifiers): 
A recent study263 analysing case law relating specifically to IP addresses found that in the vast 
majority of cases analysed the courts had identified these identifiers as personal data in the 
cases under decision, by applying the interpretation provided in recital 26 of the data 
protection directive on whether or not a person is identifiable. In 84% of the relevant 48 cases 
courts considered IP addresses personal data on the basis that they relate to an identifiable 
individual, in particular when the data controller has the intention to identify the individual, 
when other data elements were present that made identification easier or when the court 
applied a principle of caution regarding identifiability. The interpretation of identifiability 
depends to some extend on how the national legislator has used the explanation provided in 
recital 26 in its national legislation. Several Member States have integrated the explanation of 
identifiability in the national legislation as part or the definition of personal data, thus 
providing a more stringent basis to national courts than the Directive itself. Differences in 
national interpretation regarding online identifiers can accordingly be explained to some 
degree by differences in national transposition laws, which also include other modifications of 
the definition264. By moving the explanation of the term 'identifiable person' from the recital 
to a substantive provision and by further clarifying the related recital, diverging interpretation 
will be avoided and more harmonised interpretation ensured. 
This will have a beneficial impact on individuals, which will have enjoyed increased and 
effective protection of their personal data across all Member States.  
In order to assess the impact of these clarifications on data controllers, it must be taken into 
account that no substantial change of the legal situation is envisaged, but a clarification of 
                                                 
263  Timelex study on case-law regarding IP addresses […] 
264  [Examples to be added] 
 
EN 105   EN 
existing rules. Data controllers are not faced with new obligations, but with a clarification of 
existing already applicable law. Considering the Article 29 WP has already for a long time 
recommended to treat online identifiers as personal data as concerns the rules applied to their 
processing265, those data controllers who followed this advice would not have to take any 
additional measures and would thus not experience any changes of their processing and not 
suffer any additional costs of administrative requirements. This interpretation has recently 
been confirmed by the ECJ in its ruling of 24 November 2011266. 
b) Definition and modalities of consent 
As also pointed out in the opinion adopted by WP29 on consent, it seems essential to clarify 
that valid consent requires the use of mechanisms that leave no doubt of the data subject’s 
intention to consent, while making clear that – in the context of the on-line environment - the 
use of default options which the data subject is required to modify in order to reject the 
processing ('consent based on silence') does not in itself constitute unambiguous consent. This 
would give individuals more control over their own data, whenever processing is based on 
his/her consent. As regards impact on data controllers, this would not have a major impact as 
it solely clarifies and better spells out the implications of the current Directive in relation to 
the conditions for a valid and meaningful consent from the data subject.   
In particular, to the extent that 'explicit' consent would clarify – by replacing "unambiguous" 
– the modalities and quality of consent and that it is not intended to extend the cases and 
situations where (explicit) consent should be used as a ground for processing, the impact of 
this measure on data controllers is not expected to be major.  
The current requirement for unambiguous' consent has been translated in the various 
languages quite differently (in some cases even with the word 'explicit'267) and subject to a 
variety of interpretations. 'Explicit' consent ensures, on the other hand, that consent is clearly 
expressed by the individual concerned – not necessarily and not solely in writing, it is not the 
purpose of imposing one specific modality - where consent is required as a legal ground for 
processing personal data. Additional legal certainty would be provided by specifying in a 
recital that consent must result at least from a "clear affirmative action" of the data subject 
and that data controllers must be "in a position to demonstrate that consent has been 
obtained". This is, on substance, in line with WP29 opinion on consent268.  
Individuals would greatly benefit from the clarification of consent and from a strengthening 
of the modalities for consent, as this would allow them to be more aware that they indeed 
indicate their wishes in relation to the processing of their personal data and better informed 
about what they are consenting to ‘ex ante’, if consent is required. They would also be 
enabled to ask the controller ex-post for a proof of their consent in cases where they contest 
having given their consent or the extent of their consent. Thus the control of the data subject

EN 106   EN 
over their own data would be strengthened. 
As regards controllers, this can bring significant benefits in terms of responsibility and the 
effective protection of personal data, as it is made sure that only consent that is construed in a 
solid way is taken as such and can be relied upon by controllers. 'Explicit' consent helps the 
controller to demonstrate that the individual has given his/her consent and to comply with 
their burden of proof. This would enhance legal certainty also for the controller that he could 
rely on the individual's consent has a legal ground for processing his/her personal data.   
What is also important to clarify is that consent cannot be a valid ground for processing when 
there is a clear imbalance between the data controller and the data subjects (e.g. in the 
employment context). 
The administrative burden linked to this obligation is included in the estimate for measuring 
the general obligation for the controller to demonstrate compliance with data protection law 
(see Annex 9). 
c) Data portability 
The possibility to move data from one service provider to another would increase competition 
in some sectors, e.g. between social networks, and could also make data protection an element 
in this competition, when users decide to move away from a service they do not consider 
appropriate in terms of data protection. 
Given that the transfer of data about users is usually already possible through other interfaces, 
e.g. for third party application developers or for exchanges with affiliated companies, the 
costs for implementation are minimal. In fact, use of existing interfaces for these purposes 
may allow the development of portability functions very quickly. 
d) "Right to be forgotten"  
The clarification of the right to be forgotten would strengthen users' control on their own data 
by enabling individuals to decide whether or not to share personal information as well as to 
impede the continued use of their data by data controllers, data processors or third parties. 
The adverse effect of data retained and retrieved after a long time has lapsed (e.g. in 
employment area, where a prospective employer may be prevented from hiring someone on 
the basis of information on political opinions which may have changed in the meantime) 
would be avoided. 
Therefore, the reinforcement of the right to be forgotten would greatly benefit the data 
subjects, especially (but not exclusively) in online environments, such as social networks or 
cloud computing platforms: the data subject's right to remove his/her personal data from such 
a service would be more clearly stated in data protection rules. 
As far as the data controllers are concerned, as with data minimisation, the right to be 
forgotten will avoid the retention of data that are outdated and often useless for the data 
controller. Another advantage is that this will stimulate innovation in this area.  
On the other hand, this right, if it is carried out in an automatic way will imply some 
technological changes, necessary to affix an "expiry date" on data or sets of data. This will 
involve costs for data controllers.  
 
EN 107   EN 
The "right to be forgotten" will, however, not apply to activities subject to exemptions and 
derogations provided for under the provisions for processing for private purposes ("household 
exemption") and under processing for journalistic and literary purposes; it would therefore be 
ensured that the right to be forgotten does not affect freedom of expression and is used by 
individuals to attempt to alter or disappear from the public record. The media's role in keeping 
such public record will therefore not be affected. 
e) Adding genetic data to the category of sensitive data  
The explicit inclusion of genetic data as a special category of personal data requiring specific 
safeguards (“sensitive data”) would bring about an important positive impact for individuals 
as it would address the particular concern that genetic data is properly and securely dealt with 
in all Member States. Equally, the harmonised approach would bring about positive impacts 
for those controllers who process genetic data as they could enjoy legal certainty for this 
processing in all Member States. 
f) Children data 
When services are specifically addressed to children, the information provided and the tools 
to control the protection of personal data must be adapted to the target group's expected 
capabilities. Privacy notices that are written for lawyers and complex privacy setting 
mechanisms that require deep understanding of the functioning of IT and online services 
cannot be considered appropriate. Appropriate information and mechanisms would greatly 
improve the possibility for children to exercise their data protection rights more effectively. 
The additional burden for data controllers would be limited if from the very beginning, 
products and services are designed to include children-friendly privacy information and 
settings ("data protection by design"). In relation to rules on consent in the online 
environment for children below 13 years – for which parental authorisation is required – it 
should be noted that they build on existing US regulations and practices (see in particular the 
Children Online Data Protection Act of 1998) and are not expected to impose undue and 
unrealistic burden upon providers of online services and other controllers. This would also not 
interfere with Member States' contract laws, which would remain unaffected. The methods 
and modalities to obtain verifiable consent would be left to Commission's implementing 
measures.  
e) Clarification of the rules applying to data processing by individuals for private purposes:  
Under this option, the current "household exemption" contained in Article 3 (2) first indent of 
the Directive would be clarified to exclude purely domestic processing addressed to a 
'definite' number of individuals. This would reduce to zero the burden of data protection 
compliance costs when relating to activities which are solely carried out in the course of 
private or family life of individuals (which is not the case with the processing of personal data 
consisting in publication publicly available on the internet so that those data are made 
accessible to an indefinite number of people). 
Article 9 of Directive 95/46/EC, however, would be reformulated in a way that it would cover 
all activities which aim at the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas and 
protected by the right to freedom of expression, irrespective of the medium which is used to 
transmit them and of the person transmitting them, i.e. not linking the exceptions and 
derogations to "journalism" only. Doing so would bring private individuals engaged or 
 
EN 108   EN 
claiming to be engaged in informing the public online via blogs, YouTube, Twitter, etc. under 
the scope of Article 9 of Directive 95/46/EC.  
Under this solution, the situation of data subjects would change compared to the current 
situation. Private individuals who disclose information, opinions or ideas to the public –  e.g. 
through blogs, YouTube or Twitter, protected by the freedom of expression – would be 
treated the same way like media professionals which process personal data “solely for 
journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression” and thus have to be 
exempted by Member States from certain provisions of data protection requirements if 
necessary to reconcile the right to data protection with the rules governing freedom of 
expression. In contrast to the current situation following the “Lindqvist” case269, data subjects 
would not be able to rely anymore on the full set of data protection rights and remedies 
against private individuals that process their personal data on the internet accessible by an 
indefinite number of people. However, these possible exemptions from data protection laws 
would not deprive data subjects from their right to protection of private life. Data subjects will 
continue to be able to rely on civil and criminal law remedies developed under national law to 
enforce their right to private life against private bloggers, twitterers, etc. 
8) Benefits for individuals from strengthened DPAs and more consistent enforcement 
(See above under 2.1) 
9) Strengthened remedies: 
a) role of associations 
In those cases where an individual is affected by an infringement of data protection rules, a 
considerable number of other individuals in a similar situation might be equally affected. 
Actions on behalf of individuals which might be brought by a representative entity (e.g. 
ombudsman, consumer or civil society association), should encourage beneficial remedies 
against infringement of the data protection rules, in particular by allowing savings for the 
parties involved and increasing the efficiency of both judicial and out-of-court redress with 
the supervisory authorities.270  
b) strengthened sanctions: 
Experience in Member States shows that administrative sanctions, such as fines, serve as an 
important incentive for controllers and processors for compliance. Individuals could be 
ensured that a data protection violation would not be sanctioned differently from one Member 
State to the other. At the same time, further harmonised rules on administrative sanctions 
would bring about major benefits for controllers and processors as these sanctions for 
breaches of applicable data protection law within any European jurisdiction would cease to 
                                                 
269  ECJ, Case C-101/01, Bodil Lindqvist, 6.11.2003, ECR [2003] I-12971. 
270  Consumer organisations (e.g. BEUC, Consumer Focus) and non-governmental organisations (e.g. 
Privacy International) have expressed strong support for the establishment of collective redress 
mechanisms, both at national and European levels, as an efficient tool for data subject’s empowerment 
and business compliance. The European Economic and Social Committee is equally of the opinion that 
consideration should be given for business and professional organisations and trade unions to represent 
individuals and bring an action before courts. 
 
EN 109   EN 
vary depending on the approach taken by the applicable regulator, and thus, provide for more 
business predictability.  
10) Introduce a general obligation for data controllers to demonstrate  compliance with 
data protection law (including through evidence that data subjects' consent was 
sought and obtained wherever necessary, as well as DP Impact Assessments and 
Data Protection Officers, where applicable) 
Under this option data controllers will be obliged to demonstrate their compliance with data 
protection rules in cases of audit by date protection authorities. Annex 9 estimates the net 
administrative burden of this obligation to amount to € 600 million per annum, assuming 
100% compliance by data controllers. The need not to impose an undue burden on SMEs is 
taken duly into account when formulating these obligations, in particular in relation to DPOs 
and DPIAs, and including in the empowerment of the Commission to adopt delegated acts 
where the principle of "think small first" is integrated.  
a) Additional information obligations 
The introduction of mandatory information requirements relating to the quality of information 
provided to data subjects, as part of the enhanced transparency, will positively strengthen the 
information of data subjects about the processing of personal data relating to them. This is a 
pre-condition to give the data subject a say in the processing of personal data, ‘ex ante’, i.e. 
prior to processing and for exercising their data protection rights in general.  
For controllers, further information requirements can bring significant benefits in terms of 
accountability and the effective protection of personal data. Though the introduction of 
further mandatory information requirements for controllers entails a an additional 
administrative burden for data controllers (estimated to be approximately € 180 million per 
annum in Annex 9, assuming 100% compliance by data controllers), the cost can be justified 
in terms of enhanced accountability and compliance and should be seen in the context of the 
drastic reduction of other ex-ante controls from DPAs (e.g. simplification of notifications). 
This additional compliance cost must therefore be balanced with the eliminated costs of 
notification obligations. 
b) More responsibility for processors 
New and harmonised provisions which clarify the legal obligations for the processor, 
irrespective of the obligations laid down in the contract or the legal act with the controller, as 
well as the application of the “data protection by design” principle, the need for data 
protection impact assessments in some cases, and an obligation to cooperate with supervisory 
authorities will bring about benefits for the individual, as this will ensure that outsourcing and 
delegation by controllers to processors do not result in lowering the standard of data 
protection.  
While these measures might entail some initial additional compliance cost for the processors, 
the cost can be justified in terms of enhanced accountability and compliance, making it easier 
in the long run for controllers to choose a processor providing sufficient guarantees for 
processing. 
c) DPOs – see detailed assessment in Annex 6  
 
EN 110   EN 
d)DPIAs –  see detailed assessment in Annex 6  
e) Data protection by design  
Data protection by design is a measure aimed at reducing the risks of infringements of the 
data protection legislation. This would not be a requirement targeting designers and 
developers but data controllers, which should implement it when defining their data 
protection and privacy policies, especially but not solely in the field of security. It can be 
estimated to a few percentage points of the total development cost of the product or service. 
It shall also be considered that – as confirmed by a recent study conducted by the Ponemon 
Institute271 - the cost of compliance is much lower than the cost of non compliance. Recent 
incidents, such as a data breaches that occurred in major companies and where personal data 
about millions of individuals have been stolen, have shown that the cost of non compliance, 
or poor compliance are huge. Data protection by design can help reducing such risks and thus 
be beneficial both to the data controller and the individuals concerned.   
No administrative burden would be incurred by either public authorities or data controllers as 
a result of the introduction of the data protection by design principle. 
14.1.6. 2.3. Problem 3: Inconsistencies and gaps in the protection of personal data in the 
field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters 
Policy Option 2 
11) Extending the scope of data protection rules in the area of police cooperation and 
judicial cooperation in criminal matters 
Measures under this option would have positive impacts on data protection in the area of 
police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, both for individuals and law 
enforcement authorities, as they would entail: 
• The elimination of gaps, in particular by the fact of extending the scope of rules also to 
'domestic' data processing, thus ending the artificial and unpractical distinction between 
cross-border and non-cross border data processing. This would be fully in line with 
Article 16 TFEU; 
• The extension of general data protection principles to this area would have a positive 
impact on the standards of protection, and thus on individuals' data protection rights, in 
particular by strengthening the rules on right of access, transparency  and on purpose 
limitation; 
• Benefits for police and judicial authorities due to more legal certainty and consistency of 
the rules in this area, which would facilitate exchanges of personal data between 
authorities of different Member State.

EN 111   EN 
The additional specific safeguards to be put in place will be beneficial to data subjects by 
giving them additional protection in an area where the processing of personal data may be 
more intrusive. The increased harmonisation of the conditions for access to one's own 
personal data, or  i or the distinction to be made  between various categories of data subjects 
(criminal suspects, victims, witnesses, etc.) would strenghten data subjects' legal position vis-à-
vis police authorities. 
This would have some, but limited impact on police and criminal authorities in the Member 
States: today’s data protection principles, in particular the principle of data quality but also 
the principle of necessity and the principle of proportionality, already require a controller to 
distinguish between different categories of data subjects, as this is relevant inter alia for the 
use and storage of that data. In the police sector, the distinction between a suspect of a 
criminal activity and a non-suspect comes particular to mind as well as a data classification 
between verified and unverified information.  
Moreover, the exemptions and limitations foreseen to the rights of the data subject (of 
information, access etc) allow taking into account the specific needs of law enforcement 
authorities, in line with Declaration N° 21.   
As regards international transfers, the increased harmonised approach would provide additional 
legal certainty for both individuals and competent authorities, which is currently lacking272. 
Additional obligations upon competent authorities – such as the appointment of a DPO – have 
been tailored to the nature of the activities of such authorities and are proportionate to the 
objective pursued, i.e. to ensure a high level of data protection, without hindering police activities. 
As regards the DPO, this function can easily be performed at central level (central police 
authority) and is not meant to impose an undue burden on each police office/department.  .  
12) Addressing fragmentation 
The increased harmonisation of the rules and the extension of the scope of the Framework 
Decision, as described above, would also reduce fragmentation and increase legal certainty in 
this area for both individuals and competent authorities. A certain degree of fragmentation 
would nevertheless remain as the other "former third pillar instruments" are not specifically 
amended. This would, however, be counterbalanced by the evaluation to be carried by the 
Commission that would help identifying any possible incompatibility and propose 
amendments where necessary. 
14.1.7. 3. POLICY OPTION 3: DETAILED LEGAL RULES AT EU LEVEL 
14.1.8. 3.1. Problem 1: Barriers for business and public authorities due to fragmentation, 
legal uncertainty and inconsistent enforcement 
1) Increasing harmonisation - Detailed rules for specific sectors (e.g., employment, 
health, scientific and historical research) 
By providing for further harmonisation of rules for specific sectors (health/medical and 
employment) the internal market dimension would be further improved and the free flow of 
                                                 
272  See the Implementation report of the Framework Decision (COM…)…  
 
EN 112   EN 
data would be favoured, with more legal certainty and reduced costs for data controllers, 
currently exposed to different requirements.  
However, a high level of detail and sectoral specificity would increase the risk of the rules 
becoming outdated and ineffective very quickly in view of rapid technological and economic 
development, so that frequent revisions of the instrument would be required to maintain the 
effectiveness of the provisions. An approach allowing for more flexible adaptations, e.g. by 
implementing acts, could be much more beneficial. 
2) Abolition of the notification requirements 
The abolition of the general notification obligations for data controllers would entail a 
significant reduction of the current administrative burden for data controllers - particularly 
those operating cross-border and hence incurring the cost of notifications in more than one 
Member State - and would simplify the regulatory environment, without having a negative 
impact in terms of the protection of data subjects, given its limited added value in that respect. 
Annex 9 estimates the cost to data controllers to be EUR 200 per notification. It is estimated 
that there are approximately 650,000 notifications in the EU per year, therefore resulting in an 
approximate cost of € 130 million per annum, incurred by data controllers. The abolition of 
notifications would therefore eliminate these costs, as well as the costs linked to notification 
fees (not included in the calculation of the administrative burden). 
There is an almost unanimous support from stakeholders – particularly economic operators - 
for radically simplifying the current system and, in some cases, for abolishing notifications 
altogether. 
This change would have, however, a negative impact on those DPAs that are funded by the 
fees to be paid when notifying a data processing273.  
3) Development of an EU-wide certification/standardisation scheme (privacy seal) 
Such a measure could be beneficial for both controllers, in the EU and in 3rd countries, as it 
could make their compliance more 'visible', and for individuals, who would be reassured that 
their data are effectively protected. 
However, the cost of certifying products by third parties is high. For instance, in the existing 
voluntary certification program Europrise, the cost of certifying a single product or service 
varies from 10 man days of work of a data protection expert, for a very simple product to up 
to 100 man days of work for complex products or services. Therefore, making a 
standardisation scheme mandatory of all processing would have a significant cost, superior to 
the existing compliance costs.  
4) Setting up of a central EU Data Protection Authority (via a new EU agency) 
responsible for the supervision of all data processing with an internal market 
dimension or with an effect on the European area of freedom, security and justice 
                                                 
273  This concerns, in particular, the UK DPA (ICO), for which notifications represent currently by large the main 
source of funding. They consider that a fee-based funding model for DPA is the most suitable to ensure the actual 
independence of the DPA from the Government.  
 
EN 113   EN 
Enforcement would be considerably improved thanks to the setting up of a pan-European 
Authority /regulatory Agency competent to issue binding decisions on Member States. This 
option would, however, entail significant costs for the EU budget.  
Examining other institutional bodies with a similar mandate and objective in order to identify 
comparison benchmarks, reveals that an EU regulatory Agency would require a substantial 
budget allocation, within the range of EUR 7-15 million. In the current economic climate, 
such an economic burden is not likely to be welcome by Member States or the European 
Parliament. 
Indicatively: 
• The overall 2011 budget for the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) 
amounts to EUR 7,6 million 
• For the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) the 2008 budget amounted to EUR 
15 million (and is expected to reach up to EUR 22 million by 2013) and   
• For the European Network and Information Security Agency, EUR 8,1 million for 
2011.  
In addition, this could be against EU law as an Agency cannot exercise genuine discretionary 
powers.  
5) Establishing minimum rules with regard to the definition of criminal offences 
and sanctions in the area of personal data protection 
EU minimum rules with regard to the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area 
of personal data protection, to be implemented by Member States, would foster the 
confidence of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data through a more 
efficient fight against crimes involving personal data. Such rules would also lessen the 
incentive and possibility for criminal controllers or processors to choose the Member State 
with the most lenient legal system as a certain approximation of the national laws prevents the 
existence of such "safer havens". Additionally, common rules strengthen mutual trust between 
the supervisory authorities, and judiciaries of the Member States. This facilitates cooperation 
and mutual recognition of judicial measures. On the other side, criminal investigations and 
sanctions may have a significant impact on individuals' rights and have a 'stigmatising' effect.  
However, this would be a very far-reaching measure – to be based on a specific legal basis 
(Article 83 TFEU) – that would encounter strong resistance from Member States. 
14.1.9. 3.2. Problem 2: Difficulties for individuals to stay in control of their personal data   
6) Extension of categories of sensitive data to: children, biometric and financial data 
The extension of special categories of “sensitive data” to those relating to biometric 
identifiers and of financial data, coupled with detailed rules on when processing would be 
lawful, would vigorously improve the level of protection for those data and this option would 
have a very high positive impact. In relation to the rights of the child, this option would 
increase the protection of children.  
 
EN 114   EN 
Inclusion of financial data would be more controversial given its impact on the financial 
sector, whose processing would have to be generally adapted to the new data protection 
requirements. 
7) Introduction of specific provisions on online identifiers and geo-location data 
Under this PO specific Articles would regulate a specific regime for online identifiers and 
geo-location data. While this could have the advantage of allowing for more flexibility, it 
would affect the technological neutrality of the Directive, which would risk of becoming 
rapidly obsolete. 
8) Making (explicit) consent as the primary legal ground for processing 
This measure would sensibly change the current model in the Directive, based on six different 
grounds for processing and where consent does not have a primary role but is just one of 
them. This could be justified given that Article 8 of the Charter explicitly mentions only 
"consent" (and not other legal grounds). 
However, this would create a very rigid system which would be both very costly for data 
controllers to use – as they would be obliged to base their processing more often on consent, 
and be able to prove it - and not necessarily in the interest of individuals. An 'abuse' of 
consent as a legal ground for processing can, on the contrary, rather lead to a much poorer 
quality of it.   
9) Specific thresholds and criteria for notifying data breaches to data subjects 
This measure would provide more legal certainty for data controllers. However, it would risk 
being rejected by stakeholders if not based on sound evidence and analysis of the 
implementation of existing legislation. Reports and studies are being prepared on the 
implementation of the e-Privacy Directive, which could be used to define specific obligations 
consistently across al sectors.   
10) Collective redress  
Where breaches of EU law (and in particular, data protection law) harm a large group of 
individuals and businesses, individual legal actions are often not an effective means to stop 
unlawful practices or to obtain compensation for the harm caused by these practices: 
individuals and businesses are often reluctant to initiate private lawsuits against unlawful 
practices, in particular if the individual loss is small in comparison to the costs of litigation. 
As a result, continued illegal practices cause significant aggregate loss to individuals and 
businesses. In addition, as acknowledged by the Digital Agenda for Europe, enforcement of 
EU Law in the Digital Environment appears sometimes to be difficult because of the lack of 
clarity on the applicable rights especially for consumers. Uncertainty and perceived difficulty 
to access redress is one important factor undermining confidence and thus constitutes an 
obstacle to the development of cross-border electronic commerce. Moreover, where breaches 
of EU law do trigger multiple individual lawsuits, the procedural laws of many Member 
States often leave the courts ill-equipped to deal with the case load efficiently and within 
reasonable delay. This can be true for injunctive collective redress, but in particular for claims 
 
EN 115   EN 
to obtain compensation. For these reasons, mechanisms of collective redress are being 
considered in order to remedy the current shortcomings in the enforcement of EU law274. 
Not only are collective actions important for ensuring full compensation or other remedial 
action; they also perform indirectly a deterrence enhancing function. The risk of incurring 
expensive collective damages in such actions would multiply the controllers’ incentives to 
effectively ensure compliance. In this regard, an enhanced private enforcement by means of 
collective redress mechanisms would complement public enforcement.275 
Nonetheless, given that the Commission has conducted a wide public consultation on the 
issue of collective redress276 in order to explore policy options for a coherent European 
approach and consider possible further action, it would not be prudent to pre-emptively 
introduce provisions relating to collective redress in the data protection reform package. 
14.1.10. 3.3. Problem 3: Inconsistencies and gaps in the protection of personal data in the 
field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters 
11) More prescriptive and stringent rules 
The fact of providing for very prescriptive rules (i.e. imposing direct access) would not take 
into account the need to leave some flexibility to Member States in an area which remains 
sensitive. Including biometrics amongst the sensitive data would also be disproportionate 
given the needs of law enforcement authorities to use fingerprints etc in their routine work. 
Equally, carrying out a DPIA – even if only for processing of data into large scale systems, 
when the processing is likely to be risky - would impose a disproportionate obligation upon 
police and other law enforcement authorities – who already act under the legality principle – 
and  could hinder the performance of their tasks.     
12) Maximum coherence and consistency of the rules in the former third pillar  
In addition to measures foreseen in Policy Option 2 - which are highly beneficial to 
individuals and enhance data protection in this area – under this policy option consistency and 
coherence of the rules would be maximised by amending other ex-third pillar instruments, to 
the extent that they would be incompatible with the new rules.  
This would, however, have an important impact on existing forms of (police and judicial 
cooperation) as regulated in the specific instruments that would be affected and should not be 
attempted without serious evaluation.

ANNEX 6 
 
DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF 
DATA PROTECTION OFFICERS (DPOS)  
AND DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (DPIAS) 
 
15.  
Introduction  
A central objective of the data protection reform package is to increase the effectiveness of 
data protection rights, by enhancing the responsibility and accountability of data controllers. 
Two particular measures included in the preferred policy option which aim to achieve this 
objective are the introduction of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and Data Protection Impact 
Assessments (DPIAs).  
This Annex provides a detailed analysis of the expected impacts of new provisions on DPOs 
and DPIAs. In general terms, the two proposed changes are expected to have some economic 
impacts on data controllers, particularly in terms of compliance costs. For this reason, in the 
course of the public consultation some stakeholders were opposed to the introduction of such 
obligations. However, while it may be easy to overestimate the potentially negative cost-
related impacts of these measures, the benefits they can portend if a targeted, threshold-based 
approach is adopted, should not be overlooked. 
 
Data Protection Officers 
o Background 
The designation of data protection officers is an issue on which several stakeholders have 
provided input in the context of the public consultation, some highlighting potentially 
negative impacts in terms of compliance costs. 
Some of the stakeholder responses raised questions as to which type or size of organisation 
would have to designate a data protection officer. Germany already mandates a DPO for 
organisations with more than 10 employees. Existing studies point to the fact that larger 
corporations, especially multinationals, usually already have data protection officers. The 
same is true for many public data controllers in a number of Member States. The evidence 
from the German example is that introduction of DPOs has been successful, due to the 
development of best practices in specific sectors and the streamlining of administrative costs 
due to exemptions from centralised notification requirements.  
 
EN 117   EN 
Some stakeholders argued that the requirement to designate DPOs should not be extended to 
SMEs because of the costs that would be incurred. Others argued that if DPOs were 
mandated, then concessions should be made, specifically to exempt data controllers from 
some reporting obligations.  
Furthermore, it can be expected that some organisations, perhaps a majority, will use existing 
staff to perform the function of a DPO; they will not recruit additional staff, rather they will 
assign an additional responsibility to an existing staff member, especially where they believe 
that the DPO function will not require a full-time, dedicated staff member. Yet other 
organisations may not seek to designate a DPO to their respective organisations; instead, they 
will seek to draw on independent DPOs who provide services various clients. External 
contracting of work related to the responsibilities of a DPO, while still incurring some costs, 
might reduce labour and compliance burdens overall.  
o Envisaged measures in Policy Option 2 
Policy Option 2 envisages the introduction of the mandatory appointment of Data Protection 
Officers (DPOs) for public authorities, for companies above 250 employees and those whose 
core business involves risky processing. Conditions would be set to ensure the independence 
of the DPO from the data controller as regards the performance of his/her duties and tasks.  
It will also be clarified that where the controller or processor is a public authority or body the 
DPO can be appointed for several of its entities, taking account of the organisational structure 
of the public authority or body. Even in cases where a DPO is not required, a register on data 
processing activities should be kept by the data controller. 
It is a reasonable assumption that, as with other professionally provided services, such as 
accounting, general legal advice etc., a rate of € 250 per hour will be an EU average in terms 
of employing external contractors to perform DPO-related compliance activities. 
As such it is envisaged that most data controllers – other than larger organisations better 
equipped or already having a substantive expenditure on DPOs or employees performing such 
duties as part of the normal terms of their employment – will make use of a mixture of means 
to ensure compliance with compulsory aspects of the proposed changes to the data protection 
regulatory framework in the EU. 
These elements could be: 
1. Use of existing staff, with training, to perform duties and responsibilities envisaged for 
DPOs. 
2. Use of external contractors to perform these duties and responsibilities. 
3. Hiring new staff to perform these duties and responsibilities. 
The same considerations would apply for the public sector, especially considering that Policy 
Option 2 allows the flexibility of appointing one DPO for several entities within the same 
organisational structure. 
The benefits of having either a DPO or some element which will perform the duties and 
responsibilities for the DPO in a data controller can be assumed to be the following: 
 
EN 118   EN 
1. Protecting the rights of data subjects and being a conduit between the data controller 
and data subjects 
2. Reducing compliance and administrative costs 
3. Reducing losses associated with data breaches 
According to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, enterprises are distinguished by 
size according to the following specific criteria: 
Category Employees Turnover- or Balance Sheet Total 
Medium sized <250 < €50 million < €43 million 
Small <50 < €10 million < €10 million 
Micro <10 < €2 million < €2 million 
 
Eurostat figures indicate that the majority of EU enterprises are small and micro sized 
enterprises.277

o Sub-options as regards the designation of Data Protection Officers 
•  
• For public data controllers: a general obligation to 
designate a DPO, without exceptions, but with flexibility 
allowing the appointment of the same DPO for several 
entities under the same organisational structure.  
• For private sector data controllers, three sub-options are 
considered: 
a. SUB-OPTION 1: DPOs should be designated when processing is carried out by large 
enterprises (more than 250 employees) and when processing is likely to present 
specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; OR 
b. SUB-OPTION 2: DPOs should be designated when the processing is likely to present 
specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects); OR 
                                                 
277 Eurostat 2008 figures, available at http:\epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-
031/EN/KS-SF-08-031-EN.pdf 
 
EN 119   EN 
c. SUB-OPTION 3: DPOs should be optional, while providing incentives to data 
controllers that do designate a DPO in terms of the supervision they undergo by 
national authorities. 
•  
o Expected impacts 
The compulsory requirement to designate a DPO for public authorities would entail a cost for 
Member States’ public authorities. It is difficult to estimate such costs given that many 
public authorities already have DPOs (this varies between Member States) and that 
organisational structure and data processing varies between public authorities. Moreover, it 
would be reasonable to expect that the role of DPO would be assume by existing civil 
servants in public authorities, who will be suitably trained to perform the function, and that no 
additional staff would need to be recruited. Additionally, the fact that it is possible to appoint 
a DPO for several entities of a public administration will limit the burden even further. 
Therefore it can be expected that the financial cost of introducing this obligation would not be 
disproportionate to the risks involved in the processing of personal data by public authorities. 
As regards the private sector, the impacts of each sub-option are expected to be the following: 
For Sub-Option 1: 
• The exclusion of economic operators with less than 250 employees (i.e. excluding all 
SMEs and micro enterprises) is intended to facilitate the business environment for 
comparatively smaller operators by reducing the burden of data protection compliance 
costs.  
• Exempting micro, small and medium sized enterprises from the provisions would 
exclude 99.8% of EU enterprises.  
• In some specific instances enterprises of this size might however be reasonably 
assumed to fall under the provisions of this requirement, where the processing might 
present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. These might include, 
for instance: 
1. High-tech start-up enterprises working in particular fields, e.g. health. 
2. Enterprises whose processing of personal data involves an evaluation of personal 
aspects relating to the data subject, including his or her ability, efficiency and 
conduct;   
3. Enterprises processing children's, genetic, biometric, financial or location data 
4. Enterprises processing data obtained from video surveillance 
 
In Sub-Options 2 and 3 it can be assumed that in most cases the larger enterprises’ DPO 
would have a role in ensuring compliance with sub-contractors. Assuming that 100% of large 
enterprises will be data controllers, this would entail 40,000 large size enterprises having to 
designate a DPO. It is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of large organisations 
processing personal data already have employees with the responsibilities to perform the 
duties of DPOs. From stakeholder feedback during the impact assessment study the total 
labour cost associated with recruiting an additional employee as a full-time DPO was 
estimated at €80,000 per annum.  
 
 
EN 120   EN 
Number of large enterprises involved 40,000 
% Rate of DPO designation 100% 
DPO required 40,000 
Total Labour Cost €3.2 billion 
(per annum) 
 
This table assumes that all large enterprises will have to designate a DPO. This would entail a 
total annual cost of €3.2 billion. However, this probably significantly overstates the outcome 
since many enterprises of this size already comply with current data protection regulations. 
That being the case, it would be reasonable to assume that a majority already have DPOs or 
related staff performing similar duties. 
 
Number of large enterprises involved 40,000 
% Rate of DPO designation 10% 
DPO required 4,000 
Total labour cost €320 million 
(per annum) 
 
This table assumes that 90 per cent of large enterprises already have staff performing 
comparable duties. For 10 per cent of enterprises requiring DPOs, the total labour cost would 
be €320 million (per annum). However, it would be reasonable to assume that, given the size 
of these enterprises, some of this cost would be reduced by re-training and re-skilling existing 
employees. It is impossible, however, to determine this with any degree of certainty. 
 
Similar considerations apply in the case of enterprises processing personal data falling under 
categories 1-6 above, as it would be impossible to determine the number of enterprises that 
process those types of data reliable certainty. Some estimates based on simplifying 
assumptions are however made below. 
 
In the following tables, it is assumed that 
• SMEs and micro-sized enterprises will either train and certify existing staff in 
performing routine data protection tasks, or recruit external contractors for that 
purpose; 
• Only 50% of SMEs and micro enterprises will be data controllers; 
 
EN 121   EN 
• External contractors charge similar rates to legal validation rates, which have been 
determined from stakeholder feedback to be €250 per hour; 
• Checking compliance in processing operations which are likely to present specific 
risks will take four hours on average for all enterprises.

This table illustrates that if 0.001% of small and medium-sized enterprises who are data 
controllers require validation in terms of processing risky data, the total cost for each data 
controller would be €1,000 with a total cost across the EU of €9,800,000 (per annum). 
 
In examining these figures, it is arguable that the costs are broadly in line with other external 
costs facing small and micro-sized enterprises such as accountancy or IT related fees. 
 
Data Protection Impact Assessments 
o Background 
The obligation for data controllers to carry out a DPIA when processing operations are likely 
to present specific risks  to the rights and freedoms of data subjects will entail some additional 
compliance costs (in terms of conducting the DPIA) and administrative burden (in terms of 
providing the information to public authorities about the DPIA).  
DPIAs, however, have the potential to simplify data protection processes for data controllers 
in the medium- to long-term by ensuring effective compliance with data protection rules. 
Recent experience in DPIAs in several Member States and internationally has shown that this 
 
EN 122   EN 
procedure has beneficial effects in terms of rationalising and streamlining processing 
operations, and closes potential gaps in compliance and security.  
A DPIA can help in identifying and managing data protection risks, avoiding unnecessary 
costs (in terms of problems being discovered at a later stage), avoiding inadequate data-
processing solutions, improving the security of personal data and most importantly for an 
economic operator, avoiding the loss of trust and reputation.  
While labour costs for some categories of data controllers might not increase due to 
employees with relevant skills and responsibilities already being in place, with regard to 
DPIAs, it can be assumed that a broader range of stakeholders will incur resource costs. 
While in some Member States, such as the UK, the use of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) 
in government departments and agencies is growing, most Member States and the vast 
majority of data controllers have yet to use PIAs or DPIAs. Estimating potential costs for 
DPIAs is dependent on a number of contextual factors.  
In theory, if a new project, technology, service, product or any scheme involves the collection 
and/or processing of personal data, a DPIA (or, better still, a PIA) would ideally be carried 
out. The scale and rigour of the DPIA will depend on how an organisation perceives the risks 
and the seriousness with which it tackles those risks. If the risks are regarded as minimal or 
negligible, then a small-scale DPIA may be conducted. If the organisation perceives 
significant risks, then it would be advisable to opt for a full-scale DPIA, one that engages 
stakeholders, with the aim of identifying all possible risks, assessing those risks and devising 
strategies to avoid or mitigate those risks.   
The reporting costs of a DPIA would be the least costly part of a DPIA – the real costs will be 
in determining whether a DPIA should be conducted, gathering information about the project, 
deciding whether to engage stakeholders (internal and/or external to the organisation), 
identifying the risks, assessing the risks, identifying options for avoiding or mitigating the 
risks and only then preparing a DPIA report, making recommendations, following up on those 
recommendations to ensure they are actually implemented. There may be additional costs if 
an external assessor is brought in to conduct the DPIA. Engaging stakeholders could take 
several forms – e.g. an online consultation, briefing meetings, working groups, face-to-face 
interviews, etc. Even if a DPIA is conducted without resorting to external stakeholders, 
usually there will be several internal stakeholders involved, e.g. legal staff, project staff, 
operational staff, procurement staff, perhaps HR staff, the public relations department, risk 
managers, internal audit staff, etc. The amount of time consumed by a DPIA (or PIA) would 
depend on how serious the privacy (or data protection) risks are estimated to be, but it could 
escalate considerably.  
 
o Benefits of conducting a DPIA 
Several benefits can be identified for conducting a DPIA278:  
                                                 
278 The benefits listed here have been extracted from Wright, David, and Paul de Hert, “Introduction to privacy 
impact assessment”, Chapter 1, in David Wright and Paul de Hert (eds.), Privacy Impact Assessment, 
Springer, Dordrecht, 2011 [forthcoming]. The book discusses PIA, rather than a more narrowly scoped 
DPIA, but the benefits of a DPIA will be broadly the same.  
 
EN 123   EN 
• A company (or government department) that undertakes a PIA with good intent, with a 
genuine interest in engaging stakeholders, including the public, has an opportunity to 
earn trust and good will from individuals-consumers. Businesses able to sustain a high 
level of trust and confidence can differentiate themselves from their rivals and thereby 
gain a competitive advantage. 
• If the project does raise difficult issues with regard to data protection, ideas from 
stakeholders may be particularly welcome. Even if stakeholders do not manage to 
generate some new considerations, the organisation at least has an opportunity of gaining 
stakeholders’ understanding and respect.  
• Transparency in the process may also be a way of avoiding liabilities downstream. If the 
organisation is able to demonstrate that it did engage and consult with a wide range of 
stakeholders, was forthcoming with information, considered different points of view, it 
will be more difficult for some stakeholders to claim subsequently that the organisation 
was negligent in its undertaking. By being open and transparent from the outset, the 
organisation can minimise the risk of negative media attention.  
• The New Zealand PIA Handbook describes a privacy impact assessment as an “early 
warning system”.  The PIA 'radar screen' can enable an organisation to spot a privacy 
problem and take effective counter-measures before that problem strikes the business as a 
privacy crisis. It goes on to say that the PIA process can help the organisation by 
providing credible information upon which business decisions can be based and by 
enabling organisations to identify and deal with their own problems internally and 
proactively rather than awaiting customer complaints, external intervention or a bad 
press. 
• PIA is a form of risk assessment, an integral part of risk management. It encourages cost-
effective solutions, since it is more cost-effective and efficient to build “privacy by 
design” into projects, policies, technologies and other such initiatives at the design phase 
than attempt a more costly retrofit after a technology is deployed or a policy 
promulgated. A PIA creates an opportunity for organisations to anticipate and address the 
likely impacts of new initiatives, to foresee problems and identify what needs to be done 
to design in features that minimise any impact on privacy and/or to find less privacy-
intrusive alternatives. 
• A PIA should also be regarded as a learning experience, for both the organisation that 
undertakes the PIA as well as the stakeholders who are engaged in the process. An open 
PIA process helps the public understand what information the organisation is collecting, 
why the information is being collected, how the information will be used and shared, 
how the information may be accessed, and how it will be securely stored. The PIA’s 
educational role is a way of demonstrating that the organisation has critically analysed 
how the project will deal with personal data. It might be the case that certain identified 
risks on privacy cannot be mitigated and/or have to be accepted (residual risks); even so, 
the PIA report, as the result of a clear and systematic process, is something to which 
interested parties can refer and be informed of the reasons why some assumptions were 
made and decisions taken. Thus, a PIA promotes a more fully informed decision-making 
process. 
 
o Expected economic impacts and case studies 
 
EN 124   EN 
As a one-off cost which might be significant, some organisations, especially smaller ones, 
might view the obligation to conduct a DPIA with concern. However, privacy impact 
assessments are a growing component of some organisations’ strategic thinking and risk 
planning in relation to the development of new products and services. Even without a 
provision about DPIA in the new data protection framework, this trend will continue. The 
recently approved RFID PIA Framework provides evidence of this. 
The first example below illustrates the indicative estimated costs of a small-scale DPIA: 
 
 
 
DPIA components Costs in euros Totals in euros 
Labour €450 x 20 days €9,000 
IT €1,000 €1,000 
Stakeholder engagement €1,500 €1,500 
Auditing €2,500 €2,500 
Total  €14,000 
 
The example above focuses on a small number of impacted data subjects utilising a new 
product offering in one Member State, involving the automatic processing of personal data. 
The assumptions made in this example are as follows: 
1. The DPIA takes 20 days to complete at a rate of €450 per day.279 
                                                 
279 This labour rate is the EU figure for external consultations. Conducting a DPIA is assumed to be a 
comparable exercise in terms of labour expertise, like other consultation and research exercises. One 
can expect some divergences in costs in Member States. 
Example 1: Small scale DPIA DataStore: Commercial and innovative uses of 
sensitive data 
 
As part of the development of its marketing operations, DataStore has purchased 
behavioural advertising software program from a non-EU vendor. The system integrates 
with DataStore’s consumer databases and those of other online service providers to target 
DataStore advertising at individuals who visit the DataStore website. Customers will be 
sent an initial sign-up e-mail explaining the data processing procedures and asking for 
consent.  
 
 
EN 125   EN 
2. The data controller conducts a limited exercise with stakeholders – in this example, 
one focus group (€1,000) and an online consultation exercise (€500). 
3. There are IT-related costs of €1,000 to analyse the feedback and data generated during 
the course of the DPIA. This also includes any costs associated with disseminating the 
results of the DPIA.  
4. 10 hours of legal validation are needed to audit the results of the DPIA prior to any 
reporting obligations or notifications. 
The second example below focuses on a medium-scale DPIA: 
 
 
 
DPIA components Costs in euros Totals in euros 
Labour €450 x 40 days 18,000 
IT €1,500 1,500 
Stakeholder engagement €10,000 10,000 
Auditing €2,500 5,000 
Total  €34,500 
 
The assumptions made in this example are as follows: 
1. The DPIA takes 40 days to complete at a rate of €450 per day.280 
2. The data controller engages stakeholders via a series of eight focus groups (€8,000) 
and an extended online consultation exercise (€2,000). 
3. There are IT-related costs of €1,500 to analyse feedback and data generated during the 
course of the DPIA. This also includes any costs associated with disseminating the 
results of the DPIA.  
                                                 
280 As stated above, this labour rate is the EU figure for external consultations.  
Example 2: LocNav: Location based data and services 
 
LocNav is a small regional operator offering satellite navigation services in a number of 
member states. It plans to implement product and service offerings with local businesses 
as part of its SatNav feature set. The service will advertise particular retail and other 
amenities for users of the system if asked to do so in planning a trip by data subjects. 
 
EN 126   EN 
4. 10 hours of legal validation are needed to audit the results of the DPIA prior to any 
reporting obligations or notification. 
The third example below illustrates a large-scale DPIA. 
 
 
 
DPIA components Costs in euros Totals in euros 
Labour €450 x 60 days x 5 Experts €135,000 
IT €1,500 €1,500 
Stakeholder engagement €10,000 €10,000 
Auditing €2,500 €2,500 
Total  €149,000281 
 
The assumptions made in this example are as follows: 
1. The DPIA takes 60 days to complete and involves five experts at a rate of €450.282 
2. The data controller engages stakeholders via eight focus groups (at a cost of €8,000) 
and an extended online consultation (€2,000). 
3. There are IT-related costs of €1,500 to analyse feedback and data generated during the 
course of the DPIA. This also includes any costs associated with disseminating the 
results of the DPIA. 
4. 10 hours of legal validation are needed to audit the results of the DPIA prior to any 
reporting obligations or notifications. 
 
                                                 
281 This figure also corresponds to stakeholder feedback for a large multi-national as to expected costs in 
conducting a privacy impact assessment. 
282 This labour rate is the EU figure for external consultations.  
Example 3: Security and biometrics 
 
In compliance with national legislation, a law enforcement data controller has 
implemented a biometric recognition system utilising airport-based CCTV systems which 
identify wanted suspects and suspicious behaviour in public spaces.  
 
 
EN 127   EN 
Estimating the administrative costs associated with DPIAs is a difficult task as the nature of 
DPIAs in and of themselves will be very context-specific to the size of enterprise needing to 
undertake one and the specific nature of the project or technology or service or other scheme 
for which the DPIA is to be conducted. Likewise, the main bulk of costs associated with a 
DPIA will arguably not be linked with the reporting obligations of proposed changes; rather 
the main body of costs will be in the consultation and identifying, assessing and mitigating 
risks as well as the actual work of conducting the DPIA itself.

ANNEX 7 
 
 ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS OF POLICY OPTIONS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 
 
1. POLICY OPTION 1:  SOFT ACTION 
This option would have positive impacts for the protection of personal data and privacy by 
clarifying and promoting the conditions for exercising the existing data subject's rights:  
- interpretative communications and explicit references to the transparency and data 
minimisation principles would increase legal certainty also in relation to data subjects' 
rights ;   
- non-legislative measures would enhance the effectiveness of individuals' rights, in 
particular by awareness-raising and promoting Privacy Enhancing Technologies and 
voluntary privacy certification schemes, which would support the application of data 
protection principles. 
However this positive impact will remain limited, as it aims to make the application of the 
existing data subjects' rights more effective, but without adding substantial changes as regards 
these rights and their enforcement. 
This option will also have a positive impact in relation to the rights of the child as clearer 
information policy and promotion of awareness-raising will contribute to the protection of 
children.   
2. POLICY OPTION 2: MODERNISED LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
This option has a very positive impact on the protection of personal data in all its 
dimensions. In particular the clarification of the role and conditions of consent will enhance 
the data subjects' control over their data. Data subjects' rights would be significantly 
strengthened by a detailed set of rules on the data subject rights, which comprises in particular 
additional information obligations for controllers towards the data subject, as a general 
precondition for exercising the rights in relation to data protection. Specific rights such as the 
right for deletion will be strengthened and clarified ("right to be forgotten"). Rules on the 
modalities will facilitate the data subject's exercising their rights. The specific safeguards on 
the protection of 'sensitive' personal data will be extended to genetic data.  
A range of further new and clarified elements would reinforce the effectiveness of the right to 
protection of personal data: reducing the fragmentation and increasing legal certainty by more 
detailed rules in the legal instrument and implementing acts and strengthened cooperation 
between Data Protection Authorities would considerably help to ensure the same level of data 
protection and the consistent implementation of the right to data protection in all MS and 
towards non EU-controllers and the effectiveness of enforcement.  
 
EN 129   EN 
The right to respect for private life would be equally strengthened by the measures to enhance 
the protection of individuals' personal data, but also, in addition, as regards the clarification of 
the exemption of purely private activities from the application of the data protection rules. 
The clarification of the rules on 'sensitive' data and its extension to genetic data would also 
enhance non-discrimination.   
The clarification of the application of rules for children will have a further positive impact on 
the rights of the child. 
The relation of data protection rules to the freedom of expression and information will be 
clarified for the media, but also for private persons, who (e.g. as bloggers) make personal data 
of other accessible for an indefinite number of individuals.   
As regards the freedom to conduct a business there would be, on the one hand, positive 
impacts by reducing fragmentation, enhancing legal certainty and simplification (such as by 
reducing the notification requirement). - On the other hand; this option contains also elements 
which could impact the freedom to conduct a business negatively. New specific requirements 
and uniform rules (e.g. introduction of Data Protection Impact Assessments, reinforced data 
subject rights, particularly when using Internet) could limit to a certain extent freedom to 
conduct business. However, such limitation does not seem disproportionate, taking account 
the positive impacts. This is in particular the case for the appointment of Data Protection 
Officers, which will be entrusted with tasks which would otherwise be carried out by other 
means, in order to comply with the data protection rules.  
The protection of intellectual property rights is not impacted by reinforced protection of data 
subject rights.  
This option would have also a positive impact on health care, as more uniform rules will be 
established for the exceptions to the processing of sensitive data, in particular those 
concerning health data.   
The right to an effective remedy will be reinforced by providing access to the courts not only 
to the individual or controller or processor concerned, but also by providing the right for 
associations to bring an action before the court on behalf of individuals. Also the right of 
DPAs to engage in legal proceedings would be clarified.  
3. POLICY OPTION 3: DETAILED LEGAL RULES AT EU LEVEL 
As regards the protection of personal data and privacy this option would have a very high 
positive impact. On top of the very positive impact of the measures provided by Policy Option 
2, the data subjects' rights and legal certainty would be further strengthened by detailed 
harmonisation in all policy fields.  
On freedom to conduct a business, this option would have a similar impact as Policy Option 
2. 
In relation to health care, there would be an increased positive impact as there would be more 
detailed harmonised rules on data protection in the health and medical sector. 
 
EN 130   EN 
As regards freedom of expression and the protection of Intellectual property rights there 
would be no additional measures, meaning that the impact would be the same impact as in 
Policy Option 2. There would be a higher positive impact on the right to an effective remedy 
and to a fair trial thanks to the introduction of collective actions in this area.

ANNEX 8 
 
CONSULTATION OF SMES 
 
INTRODUCTION  
SME panel consultations are regularly conducted through the Enterprise Europe Network, 
which is managed by DG Enterprise and Industry. SMEs in EU Member States are contacted 
by the regional associations that constitute the Enterprise Europe Network. Participation in 
the consultations is voluntary. 
In the context of this impact assessment, the SME panel was utilised in order to consult SMEs 
on the data protection obligations in the baseline scenario. 383 responses were submitted to 
the consultation. 
SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS   
The main findings of the SME consultation are the following: 
2.1. Notifications to DPAs 
Nearly one third of the participants (29.2%) stated that they notify processing of personal data 
to DPAs. Another third of respondents (33.2%) stated that their data processing does not need 
to be notified. The remainder either stated that they do not process any personal data (21.7%) 
or responded "I don’t know / not applicable" (14.4%).  
Generally, SMEs responded that they do not find these notifications particularly difficult, but 
many find them bureaucratic (30%), even if they do not notify themselves. 
Regarding the financial impact of these declarations, about 30% of those providing an 
estimate of costs considered them to be higher than €500, while about 40% estimated them at 
less than €100 and 22% between €100 and €300. However, given that 21.5% of consulted 
stakeholders did not provided any estimate and most respondents either did not answer this 
question or chose "I don’t know / not applicable", these financial estimates concern only a 
very limited subset of the panel. 
2.2. Privacy Policies on SME Websites  
A high percentage of respondents (42.8%) indicated that their privacy policy does not appear 
on their website. Slightly fewer respondents (36.8%) stated that their website does include a 
privacy policy.  
2.3. Data Protection Officers 
 
EN 132   EN 
Almost half of respondents have some type of Data Protection Officer, although only few 
(6%) stated that they employ a person to deal with data protection issues full-time, whereas 
most of these respondents (40%) stated that someone does it alongside other activities. 
A smaller share of respondents (38.1%) stated that there is no person formally assigned in 
their SME to deal with data protection issues and the remainder responded "I don’t know / not 
applicable". 
2.4. Information to data subjects and its financial impacts 
Nearly half (48.6%) of the SMEs have been providing information to data subjects, as 
required by data protection laws, but only 27.4% of responding SMEs always provide this 
information. More than 21% of respondents stated that they never provide such information 
and 25% responded "I don’t know / not applicable". 
The financial impact of information to data subjects appears to be relatively low, since 16.2% 
of respondents indicated costs of less than €100 and only about 12% of the respondents 
indicated costs exceeding €100 (3.7% indicated costs exceeding €300 and another 3.7% 
indicated costs exceeding €500). The majority of respondents (70%) answered "I don’t know / 
not applicable". 
2.5. Access of data subjects to their personal data  
The majority of SMEs consulted stated that they have never received requests from data 
subjects to access their data (53.8%). Only a minority declare having received such requests 
(about 19.3% rarely and 6.5% frequently).  
Regarding the time needed for the SMEs to respond, only 19.1% are able to roughly quantify 
it, most of those (11.5% of total respondents) indicated that it requires less than 1 day of 
work.  
Only very few stakeholders (2.6%) charge a fee for this access. These fees are generally 
between €10 and €50 with only one respondent (0.3%) charging more than €100.  
54% of SMEs do not charge a fee for such requests and 32% answered "I don’t know / not 
applicable". 
2.6. SMEs and legal advice on data protection 
Most of the consulted SMEs (54.3%) have never sought paid legal advice on data protection 
issues, whereas 20.4% responded that they have.  
Only 16.5% of respondents were able to indicate the costs of obtaining these services. These 
appear to vary somewhat, with 3.7% of respondents indicating expenses of less than €200, 
4.2% indicating expenses between €201 and €500, 3.9% indicating expenses between €501 
and €700 and 4.7% indicating expenses of more than €701. 
2.7. Data breaches 
 
EN 133   EN 
Most respondents (71.5%) have never experienced a data breach. Among the 7.1% of SMEs 
that state having experienced breaches, 1.6% related to data being lost, 2.1% stolen and 3.4% 
misused.  
Among those SMEs that experienced breaches, roughly half (i.e. 3.9% of SMEs consulted) 
informed the individuals whose data were affected by breaches, whereas the other half did 
not. Regarding the cost of the notification to affected individuals, respondents indicated that 
the notification cost: less than €500 (for 1.6% of SMEs consulted), in the range €501-1000 
(for 0.5%), in the range €1001-2000 (for 0.8%) and in the range €2001-5000 for only one 
single respondent (0.3%).

ANNEX 9 
 
CALCULATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE BASELINE SCENARIO AND 
PREFERRED OPTION 
 
 
o INTRODUCTION 
In accordance with the European Commission Impact Assessment Guidelines (in particular 
Annex 10 on administrative burden), this impact assessment closely examined the 
administrative costs imposed by existing regulation and by the preferred policy option. 
Data sources in this exercise included EUROSTAT figures, Eurobarometers, qualitative and 
quantitative data gathered through a series of public consultations with stakeholders, and desk 
research. The analysis of this annex is confined to the costs incurred by the private sector in 
order to comply with information obligations contained in the data protection rules283. Other 
compliance costs imposed by existing legislation and the preferred option are beyond the 
scope of this analysis. 
 
o METHODOLOGY  
All calculations are carried out using the Standard Cost Model (SCM). A number of 
methodological challenges were encountered in using the SCM in the context of data 
protection and adapting it to the particularities of the area. The most significant challenges 
and caveats are set out below, along with an explanation of the methodological steps 
undertaken: 
• All costs included in this calculation are considered to be administrative burdens and 
not costs that would be incurred as a result of practices undertaken by an entity even in the 
absence of the legislation. For this reason the values in the column "Business as Usual 
Costs" are always zero. 
• Directive 95/46/EC and the preferred option were thoroughly screened for information 
obligations on either enterprises or public authorities. 
• The quantitative calculations cover only the private sector; the public sector is not 
included in the calculations as no reliable statistics are available regarding the number of 
data controllers in the public sector who must comply with the Directive in the baseline 
scenario, and subsequently with the obligations in the preferred option. Framework 
                                                 
283 Annex 10 of the IA Guidelines defines administrative costs "as the costs incurred by enterprises, the 
voluntary sector, public authorities and citizens in meeting legal obligations to provide information on 
their action or production, either to public authorities or to private parties."  
 
EN 142   EN 
Decision 2008/977/EC has also been screened for information obligations that involve 
administrative burden on public authorities, but the involved costs were judged to be 
negligible, given the wide exemptions in this area as regards, for example, the duty of 
informing data subjects  that their personal data is sent cross-border for processing by 
other public authorities. 
• Whenever legal fees are considered in the calculation an estimate of €250/hour was used, 
which represents a conservative average of the varying rates across Member States. This 
was confirmed by stakeholder feedback.  
• Whenever clerical work is considered in the calculation, an estimate of the cost of a full-
time employee as €50/hour was used.  
• Regulatory origin: in the baseline scenario calculation, all information obligations have 
an EU regulatory origin, with the exception of the last row, "National Transpositions of 
Directive 95/46/EC". In the preferred option calculation, all information obligations have 
an EU regulatory origin. 
• Recurrence: all cost calculations are made on an annual basis. Wherever the value in the 
"Frequency per year" column is less than 1, the figure refers to a multiannual recurrence. 
For instance, if the figure in the "Frequency" column is 0.2 the recurrence is on a 5-yearly 
basis. 
• Concerning the total number of data controllers used in the calculation of 
administrative burden, in the absence of official statistics on the number of data 
controllers in the EU, the eventual estimate used in the SCM is based on EUROSTAT 
2008 figures on the total number of enterprises in the EU. The table below sets out the 
reasoning and steps involved in obtaining the total number of data controllers used in the 
calculation:

Based on the data protection SME 
Panel (see Annex 9), particularly 
figures relating to the compliance of 
SMEs with the current data 
protection rules285, it can be assumed 
that approximately 42% of the total 
number of companies can be 
practically considered as data

controllers within the meaning of the 
Directive. This is the approximate 
total number of enterprises/data 
controllers on which the 
administrative burden of the 
Directive is actually imposed. 
 
• Not all data controllers in the EU are affected by the problem of legal fragmentation. The 
data controllers affected would be those that process personal data of individuals from 
another Member State, and also have an establishment in that Member State, within the 
meaning of Article 4.1 (a) of the Directive, which allows for a "cumulative" and 
simultaneous application of different national laws to a same data controller established in 
several Member States. This means that such a controller will have to comply with the 
different national laws, obligations and varied requirements that apply for each of its 
establishments. It is important to note that the notion of "establishment", as confirmed by 
the opinion of the Article 29 Working Party on the issue, has generally been interpreted 
broadly by DPAs. In practice even a legal representative, a one-man office or a simple 
agent in a Member State are often considered as an "establishment", and thus lead to the 
application of the national laws of the Member States concerned.  
• In order to obtain the number of entities affected by legal fragmentation, in the absence 
of official statistics, the proxy of number of enterprises involved in cross-border trade 
was used. These figures were obtained from the 2008286 and 2010287 Eurobarometers on 
consumer protection, where 21% and 22% were observed respectively (hence the more 
conservative figure of 21% was used). The reason for choosing this proxy is that an 
enterprise conducting business cross-border in another Member State, provided that it is 
also established in that Member State (within the meaning of Article 4.1 of the Directive), 
will be subject to the data protection law of that Member State. This would in turn entail 
significant additional costs in terms of legal adaptation and ensuring compliance with the 
data protection laws of that Member State.

legal representative, a commercial agent etc in those Member States) 
926,272 
   
• The figure of 926,272 in the table above is obtained by multiplying the total number of 
data controllers in the EU (8,821,638), by the percentage of B2C companies engaged in 
cross-border trade (21%). It is assumed that the cross-border indicator of 21% applies also 
in the case of B2B cross-border trade. The resulting figure of 1,852,544 is further 
subtracted by 50% in the last row of the table to account for those data controllers which 
may not actually be established in other Member States, according to Article 4.1(a) of 
the Directive. 
• In the 2010 Eurobarometer 21% of retailers said they also sold to consumers in other EU 
countries. More precisely, 2% of retailers reported selling products and services in just 
one additional EU country, 6% mentioned two or three other EU countries and the largest 
proportion – 13% – was engaged in cross-border sales in at least four other EU countries.

3. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN CALCULATION 
(a) Baseline Scenario 
(i) Cost of information obligations: Line 1 refers to the obligation on data controllers to 
provide information to data subjects according to Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 
95/46/EC. It is estimated that 4 hours of legal validation work are required. It is 
 
EN 145   EN 
further estimated that a clerical full-time employee will need to work for two hours to 
prepare this material. The costs of reproducing the information material is assumed to 
be zero. It is assumed that this is a cost which recurs on a 5-yearly basis, in order to 
account for technological lifecycles, which would require adaptations in the 
information provided.  
(ii) Cost of providing information to data subjects about access rights: Line 2 refers to 
the obligation on data controllers to inform data subjects on whether their personal 
data are being processed, which data and which categories of data are being processed, 
the purposes of the processing, how they are being processed (manually or 
automatically), the right to request the rectification, erasure or blocking of data being 
processed, and to notify any third parties of any changes to the personal data requested 
by the data subject. It is assumed that this task requires two hours of legal validation 
(€500) and three hours of clerical work (€150), and that it is a cost which recurs on a 
5-yearly basis, in order to account for technological lifecycles, which would require 
adaptations in the information provided. 
(iii) Cost of Notifications of processing activities by data controllers to national data 
protection authorities: based on figures provided by national DPAs in their 2009 
Annual Reports, the total number of new notifications in the EU in 2009 were 
552,840. This figure was rounded up to 650.000 to account for 5 Member States that 
did not submit their statistics (DE, ES, PT, HU and LV). From stakeholder feedback 
submitted in public consultations, the cost of each new notification is estimated at 
approximately €200 per notification288, comprising 4 hours work by a full-time 
clerical employee. This figure would include updates of existing notifications as the 
means of processing may change over time. As the figure of 650.000 refers to new 
notifications per year, the number in the Frequency column is 1. 
(iv) Prior Checking: This refers to the cost of notifying public authorities about 
processing which might present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals 
(Article 20 of the Directive). This is estimated to involve 2 hours of legal validation (€ 
500) and 4 hours of clerical work (€200). There were approximately 15.000 prior 
checks reported to the Commission for 2009. This figure was rounded up to 16.000 to 
account for those Member States that did not report statistics on this.  
(v) Baseline costs of legal fragmentation in the internal market / national 
transpositions of Directive 95/46/EC: the calculation of the costs of legal 
fragmentation in terms of administrative burden is based on the following elements: 
• 10 hours of legal validation work to adapt the business model of the data controller 
to the data protection requirements of the additional Member States he is 
established in (€2,500) 
• €2,000 for translation costs (e.g. on information materials for data subjects, 
privacy policies, etc) 
• 10 hours of clerical work (€500)  
                                                 
288 This estimate is based on information received from the DPAs in NL and LU. For example, in Netherlands it 
takes about half a day to fulfil the notification requirement. In Luxembourg the company needs to 
complete 3-4 forms and the estimated cost for each file is €100. The notification form used in the UK 
fits within these estimates, and it can be extrapolated that the situation is similar in most of the Member 
States. 
 
EN 146   EN 
• It is assumed that this is a cost which recurs on a 5-yearly basis in order to account 
for technological lifecycles, which would require legal adaptations to ensure legal 
compliance. 
 
(b) Preferred Option 
(i) Introduction of an explicit principle of transparency: Line 1 refers to the 
introduction of a general principle of transparency on data controllers, which will 
practically translate into providing clear and intelligible information to data subjects. 
The obligation is estimated to involve two hours of clerical work for a full time 
employee. This will be a one-off cost of adapting to the new requirements of the data 
protection rules on transparency. 
(ii) Extending some obligations applicable to data controllers to data processors: it is 
assumed that a big majority of information obligations relating to data processors will 
be dealt with by data controllers upstream. Some obligations may be incurred by data 
processors (particularly as regards Line 3 – obligation to demonstrate compliance), but 
the number of processors affected is very difficult to estimate with any degree of 
certainty. 
(iii) Abolish the existing generalised system of notifications to DPAs: see Line 3 under 
the Baseline Scenario calculation. 
(iv) Introduction of a general obligation for data controllers to demonstrate 
compliance with data protection law: Line 4 estimates the cost of providing 
information about compliance, involving 4 hours of clerical work by a full time 
employee to gather and prepare all the relevant information. Such information may 
include disclosures about the appointment of DPOs and the conducting of DPIAs. As 
this change includes among other the appointment of specially trained personnel and 
the conduct of risk assessments through the DPIA, is assumed that this action would 
need to be performed every 3 years, in order to account for technological lifecycles, 
which would require adaptations in the information provided.  
(v) Data breach notifications: Line 5 estimates the cost of data breach notifications; it is 
estimated that currently 3,000 data breach notifications take place in the EU for the 
telecoms sector, at a cost of 20,000 each (based on 319 data protection breaches 
reported to the UK DPA in 2008/2009 and extrapolated for the EU289; figure of costs 
based on stakeholder feedback and desk research). If notification is extended to all 
sectors, it is estimated that an extra 1,000 breach notifications would occur. The 
additional cost of notifying about them would therefore be in the order of 20 million 
per annum. 
(vi) Eliminating the costs of legal fragmentation: Line 6 mirrors line 4 of the baseline 
scenario, but with a negative prefix as the estimated annual costs will be eliminated.

The calculations in this annex estimate administrative burdens to amount to:

€2.911.143.000 is attributable to legal fragmentation.  
• €1.556.749.132 in savings per annum in the preferred option, vis-à-vis the baseline

ANNEX 10 
 
 IMPACTS OF THE PREFERRED OPTION ON  
COMPETITIVENESS  
 
16. EXPECTED IMPACTS OF THE PREFERRED POLICY OPTION ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF 
THE EU ECONOMY 
This annex provides additional analysis of the expected impacts of the preferred policy option 
on the competitiveness of the European economy.  
The likely impacts are evaluated in terms of three dimensions of competitiveness: 
• Cost competitiveness: the cost of doing business, which includes the costs of factors 
of production (labour, capital and energy); 
• Capacity to innovate: the capacity of the business to produce more and/or better 
quality products and services that meet better customers' preferences 
• International competitiveness: the above two aspects could also be assessed in an 
international comparative perspective, so that the likely impact of the policy proposal 
on comparative advantages on the world markets is taken into account. 
As a horizontal initiative, the data protection reform has impacts on most industries. The 
personal data of natural persons is potentially processed in all sectors of the economy. The 
reform of European data protection rules will therefore introduce changes that cut across 
industrial sectors, and have a global impact on the economy of the EU. 
The envisaged approach of increasing harmonisation at EU level will have a significant 
impact on business and enhance the attractiveness of Europe as location to do business, at the 
same time as strengthening the EU in its global promotion of high data protection standards. 
In fact, while the reform puts individuals in a better position to exercise their data protection 
rights, it will also allow for significant cost reductions for businesses through more 
harmonisation.  
The current fragmentation of the legal framework gives rise to administrative burden costing 
EU businesses close to €3 billion per year. This cost could be removed and the resources 
made available could potentially be used by businesses to enhance their investment strategies, 
both within the EU and beyond. Thus, thanks to the reduced fragmentation of the regulatory 
environment, the EU will have a more predictable business environment in data protection, 
with a set of rules encouraging more consumer confidence and a better-functioning internal 
market. A multinational company operating in several Member States will no longer be 
subject to different requirements and the resulting costs and legal uncertainty. 
 
EN 149   EN 
17. COST AND PRICE COMPETITIVENESS 
17.1. Cost of inputs 
The costs of doing cross-border business in the internal market will be reduced considerably 
by the clarification of the rules on applicable law, so that a data controller established or using 
equipment in more than one Member State will be subject to one single law only. As a result 
of the reform, businesses will have to comply with one set of common, harmonised rules for 
the processing of personal data and ensure that personal data flows without obstacles 
throughout the EU.  
The data protection reform will create a level playing field for data controllers and reduce the 
administrative burden linked to notifications to Data Protection Authorities. Multinational 
companies with activities in more than one EU Member State will reap significant benefits 
from having to contact only one, single Data Protection Authority who will be responsible for 
their supervision, thus improving coherence and compliance and reducing costs. It will also 
reduce barriers to entry for potential new entrants, making the internal market more attractive 
and allowing them to fully exploit its potential.  
The objective of enhancing the internal market dimension of data protection is likely to have 
positive impacts on business cost efficiency, given that it proposes to: 
• establish a "one-stop-shop" for data controllers in the EU ensuring consistent 
enforcement of data protection rules, 
• rationalise the current governance system to help ensure a more consistent 
enforcement, 
• drastically cut red tape: remove unnecessary notification obligations for data 
controllers, 
• simplify requirements for international data transfers. 
Given these changes, the reform is expected to be positively received by economic operators, 
as it will reduce their overall compliance costs, particularly those linked to the currently 
fragmented rules and the data protection-related administrative burden.  
Taking account of the concerns of industry regarding the administrative and financial costs of 
implementing some of the proposed changes, and in particular to avoid the possibility of 
imposing disproportionate burdens on small companies, measures with a potential cost impact 
such as the appointment of Data Protection Officers and the conduct of data protection impact 
assessments, have  limitations and thresholds included in the relevant legal obligations, thus 
considerably limiting the cost impacts on SMEs. 
The reform is also likely to have a positive impact on consumer confidence in online 
environments, so that increased volume of transactions of goods and services through online 
channels can be expected. In addition to the providers of online services who benefit directly, 
this has the potential to benefit also the large supplier base which provides goods for online 
transactions, as well as sectors involved in the completion of online transactions, e.g. courier 
and postal services delivering the goods ordered online and related businesses. 
 
EN 150   EN 
17.2. Cost of labour 
No material changes of data protection rules relating to employment relationships are 
proposed. Clarification and harmonisation of general data protection concepts will remove 
divergences and reduce costs caused by fragmentation. 
17.3. Other compliance costs   
The appointment of data protection officers will, for those organisations to which the 
obligation applies, impose additional costs to the extent that a comparable function does not 
already exist internally or in the form of an external consultancy contract. Data Protection 
Impact Assessments will also impose costs depending on the frequency and the level of 
scrutiny required.  
On the one hand, thresholds and limitations ensure that any additional costs remain 
proportionate to the volume of operations. On the other hand, both measures contribute 
considerably to increased compliance of the organisation, which can in the long term protect 
it from expensive complaint handling, administrative investigation or litigation. This applies 
also to an obligation to demonstrate compliance by documenting internal policies and 
procedures. Furthermore, for data controllers established in more than one Member State, 
these additional compliance costs would be offset by the reduction of fragmentation (see also 
Annex 6). 
18. CAPACITY TO INNOVATE 
18.1. Capacity to produce and bring R&D to the market 
The current inconsistent implementation of EU data protection laws impacts the uptake of 
online services and new technologies in general. Individuals are affected because of a lack of 
trust in the digital environment and fears about possible misuse of their data. This creates 
opportunity costs for economic operators and public authorities and slows down innovation.  
Strong growth of the internet economy, widespread use of new mobile devices and the 
expansion of e-commerce and other web-based services could bring sizable economic 
benefits, and provide a strong platform for companies able to develop new products and 
services and to bring them to market. The EU has supported research and development in 
privacy friendly and privacy enhancing technologies, as well as in secure tools. Market 
acceptance of these technologies and tools will improve considerably when they are 
integrated into systems offered to a market of 500 million potential customers. 
18.2. Capacity for product innovation 
Clear and harmonised data protection rules can become a trigger for innovation. For example, 
privacy enhancing technologies or privacy by design and data protection consulting are 
sectors which could benefit from an environment where increased data protection safeguards 
are the norm. European industry could become world leaders in privacy enhancing 
technologies or privacy by design solutions, drawing business, jobs and capital to the 
European Union. Privacy enhancing tools for data transfer and aggregation, as well as cloud 
computing will generate new business opportunities.  
 
EN 151   EN 
18.3. Capacity for process innovation (including distribution, marketing and after-sales 
services)  
Clarification and harmonisation of data protection rules across the EU offers a larger, more 
streamlined and more open market for investment and increases incentives for innovation.  
19. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS 
19.1. Competition in internal market 
Clarification of data protection concepts and principles, more harmonisation of data 
protection law, clarification of applicable law and improved consistency of enforcement all 
contribute to creating a level playing field in the EU as far as data protection is concerned. 
They will remove incentives for forum shopping and the distortion of competition by diverse 
interpretation of existing principles. This will improve competition in the internal market and 
increase the resulting benefits in terms of subsequent downward pressure on prices and more 
innovative products and services.  
19.2. Competition in external markets 
The fact that the EU is reforming its data protection rules to enhance individual rights can be 
perceived by many businesses as a competitive advantage, providing a business environment 
where the legitimate and safe processing of personal data is rewarded with the trust of more 
consumers. 
The change in rules, making the European internal market more effective and creating a more 
predictable regulatory environment is in turn expected to make Europe become a more 
attractive place for doing business, as the rules will be less heavy and more streamlined.  
The main elements in the preferred policy option contributing to this effect are the: 
 ¾ Clarification of applicable law, ensuring that only one law applies, 
 ¾ Simplification of the conditions and procedures for third country data transfers, 
including for groups of companies, 
 ¾ General reduction of red tape and fragmentation 
 ¾ Consistent and effective enforcement. 
EU based providers will be able to offer a service with higher quality in terms of data 
protection and security at competitive prices at a global scale.
