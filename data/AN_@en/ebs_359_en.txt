EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This report presents the results of the largest survey ever conducted regarding 
citizen’s behaviours and attitudes concerning identity management, data protection 
and privacy. It represents the attitudes and behaviours of Europeans on this subject. 
The main findings of the survey are the following:  
 
? 74% of the Europeans see disclosing personal information as an increasing 
part of modern life.  
 
? Information considered as personal is, above all, financial information 
(75%), medical information (74%), and national identity numbers or cards 
and passports (73%). 
 
? Social networking and sharing sites users are more likely to disclose their 
name (79%), photo (51%) and nationality (47%). Online shoppers’ actual 
online disclosure of personal information mainly involves their names (90%), 
home addresses (89%), and mobile numbers (46%).  
 
? The most important reason for disclosure is to access an online service, for 
both social networking and sharing site users (61%) and online shoppers 
(79%). 
 
? 43% of Internet users say they have been asked for more personal 
information than necessary when they proposed to obtain access to or use 
an online service.  
 
? A majority of Europeans are concerned about the recording of their 
behaviour via payment cards (54% vs. 38%), mobile phones (49% vs. 43%) 
or mobile Internet (40% vs. 35%).  
 
? Almost six in ten Internet users usually read privacy statements (58%) and 
the majority of those who read them adapt their behaviour on the Internet 
(70%). 
 
? Over half of Internet users are informed about the data collection conditions 
and the further uses of their data when joining a social networking site or 
registering for a service online (54%). 
 
? Only one-third of Europeans are aware of the existence of a national public 
authority responsible for protecting their rights regarding their personal data 
(33%). 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 2 - 
? Just over a quarter of social network users (26%) and even fewer online 
shoppers (18%) feel in complete control.  
 
? Europeans use the following types of credentials: mostly credit cards and 
bank cards (74%), national identity cards or residence permits (68%), 
government entitlement cards (65%), or driving licences (63%). 34% of 
respondents have an account they use on the Internet, such as email, or for 
social networking or commercial services. 
 
? To protect their identity in daily life, 62% of the Europeans give the 
minimum required information.  
 
? To protect their identity on the Internet, the most usual strategies are 
technical or procedural, like tools and strategies to limit unwanted emails 
such as spam (42%), checking that the transaction is protected or the site 
has a safety logo or label (40%), and using anti-spy software (39%). 
 
? Authorities and institutions – including the European Commission and the 
European Parliament (55%) – are trusted more than commercial companies.  
 
? Less than one-third trust phone companies, mobile phone companies and 
Internet service providers (32%); and just over one-fifth trust Internet 
companies such as search engines, social networking sites and e-mail 
services (22%).  
 
? 70% of Europeans are concerned that their personal data held by companies 
may be used for a purpose other than that for which it was collected. 
 
? Turning to Europeans’ own data handling, 28% are prepared to pay for 
access to their personal information stored by public or private entities. 
 
? As regards the "right to be forgotten", a clear majority of Europeans (75 %) 
want to delete personal information on a website whenever they decide to do 
so.  
 
? Even though a majority of European Internet users feel responsible 
themselves for the safe handling of their personal data, almost all Europeans 
are in favour of equal protection rights across the EU (90%).  
 
? More than four in ten Europeans would prefer the European level of 
administration for enforcing regulation (44%), while a somewhat smaller 
number would prefer the national level (40%).

? When asked what type of regulation should be introduced to prevent 
companies from using people’s personal data without their knowledge, most 
Europeans think that such companies should be fined (51%), banned from 
using such data in the future (40%), or compelled to compensate the victims 
(39%). 
 
? A majority believe that their personal data would be better protected in large 
companies if these companies were obliged to have a Data Protection Officer 
(88%). 
 
? Europeans’ opinions are divided with respect to the circumstances under 
which the police should have access to personal data. In contrast, they 
almost all agree that minors should be protected from (95%) and warned 
against the disclosure of personal data (96%); and a vast majority are in 
favour of the special protection of genetic data (88%).

Tomorrow’s citizens: digital natives 
 
Two types of digital experts emerged from the survey. Firstly, ‘digital natives’: young 
persons born during or after the general introduction of digital technology. Secondly, 
‘digital initiates’: they are not of a young age by definition, but have become 
experienced by interacting with digital technology e.g. through work or education, 
and have different viewpoints than digital natives.  
 
Digital natives were born and raised with digital technology: they are the younger 
Europeans aged 15-24, and students. These groups appeared to stand out with 
respect to a large number of issues addressed in the survey reported here. 
Around 94% of the 15-24 are using the Internet (EU 66%). 84% of them are using 
social networking sites (EU 52%) and 73% of them are using websites to share 
pictures, videos, movies (EU 44%). They are, nevertheless, less likely to purchase 
online (54%, EU 60%). 
 
They are the most likely to agree that disclosing personal information is not a big 
issue for them (43%, EU 33%), that they do not mind disclosing personal information 
in return for free services online such as a free email address (48%, EU 29%), and 
that they feel obliged to disclose personal information on the Internet (41%, EU 
28%). They are also most likely to disclose various types of personal information on 
social networking sites, and to disclose personal information on social networking 
sites ‘for fun’ (26%, EU 22%); they usually do not read privacy statements on the 
Internet (31%, EU 25%, see part 2 of this report), but they feel sufficiently informed 
about the conditions for data collection and the further uses of their data when joining 
a social networking site or registering for a service online (64%, EU 54%, see part 2 
of this report); they are likely to have changed their personal profile from the default 
settings on a social networking site or sharing site (62%, EU 51%, see part 3 of this 
report); and they tend to hold the social networking or sharing sites responsible for 
the safe handling of data. They are also more likely to feel that they have control over 
the information disclosed on social networking or sharing sites (84%, EU 78%, see 
part 2 of this report) and over the information on online shopping websites (80%, EU 
68%, see part 2 of this report). 
Conversely, the care-free digitals are the least likely to mention the risk that their 
information may be used to send them unwanted commercial offers (24%, EU 28%, 
see part 2 of this report); to say that the websites will not honour the privacy 
statements (20%, EU 24%, see part 2 of this report); to protect their identity, either 
in daily life or on the Internet (see part 3 of this report); or to be concerned that the 
information about them held by companies may be used for a different purpose from 
that for which it was collected (63%, EU 70%, see part 3 of this report).

Digital initiates have become familiar with the Internet through their work or higher 
education rather than because of their age. Typically, they fall into the occupational 
category of managers; In contrast to digital natives, they are rather concerned, as 
reflected by their surprisingly different viewpoints on several issues. 
They are the least likely to think that disclosing personal information is not a big issue 
for them (respondents who studied until the age of 20 or more 31%, managers 27%, 
EU 33%) and they are also least likely to feel in control of their personal data, e.g. 
the ability to change, delete or correct this information, when online shopping as well 
as when they are using social networking sites (see part 2 and 3 of this report) 
In contrast, they are most likely to protect their identity in daily life and on the 
Internet, and in the widest variety of ways, and they are most often concerned with 
respect to information about them being held by companies (see part 3 of this 
report). Managers are most likely to be prepared to pay for access to their personal 
information stored by public or private entities (43%, EU 28%, see part 3 of this 
report), and to have changed the privacy settings of their personal profile from the 
default settings on a social networking or sharing site (57%, EU 51%, see part 3 of 
this report), though they also say more often than the average that it was difficult 
(22%, EU 18%, see part 3 of this report).

INTRODUCTION 
 
Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union expressly 
recognises the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. However, since 
the adoption of the Data Protection Directive in 1995, broad technological changes 
have taken place1. The ability of organisations to collect, store and process personal 
data has increased Not many digital technologies are designed to obtain detailed logs 
of their usage by individuals, which are then accessible for surveillance and marketing 
purposes. Identity management systems are information systems or technologies that 
can be used to support the management of identities: for example establishing an 
identity by linking a name or number to a person, or follow identity activity by 
recording and/or providing access to logs of identity activity, or destroy identities. 
These systems are now largely used on the Internet, and they increase the need to 
protect the user’s identity.  
 
Online activities are particularly closely monitored. Even where users are not required 
to provide personal data when accessing services on the Internet, individuals can be 
identified through the Internet Protocol (IP) address of their computer, and often 
through digital ‘cookies’ or electronic identifiers left on their browser by Web sites. 
Internet communication and browsing tends to leave logs of Web pages visited, e-
mail and instant message senders and recipients, voice over IP callers, goods 
examined and purchased, advertisements viewed and searches.  
 
What is more, this development is widespread, not only on the Internet. Cameras are 
used for surveillance. Mobile phones sending location information to the network 
providers enables contextual advertising and mapping. Debit and credit card payment 
systems record amounts spent and stores visited. Store loyalty cards enable 
databases of purchases to be compiled. Biometrics, measurements that uniquely 
identify individuals, such as fingerprints and photographs, nowadays also include DNA 
matching, and face and voice recognition. The rise of ‘Web 2.0’ technologies, allowing 
user-to-user contact, has resulted in sites for sharing pictures, videos and movies on 
Web logs (blogs), and last but not least, the nowadays enormous global social 
networks.  
 
Data mining tools have been developed to find patterns in large collections of 
personal data, to identify individuals and to attempt to predict their interests and 
preferences. Companies use these technologies to obtain large customer bases. 
Governments are increasingly analysing and exchanging information on their citizens. 
Individuals are shopping online and using social networking sites to share information 
about themselves and their family, friends and colleagues.

Overall, collection, storage and usage of personal data have become a part of 
everyday life at all levels of society. The aim of this special Eurobarometer survey 
n°359 is to gain insight in Europeans’ actual understanding and disclosure of personal 
information, their awareness that this information may be stored in databases for 
processing, their concerns regarding these further uses of their personal data, their 
ways of protecting these data and their expectations regarding the regulation of data 
protection.   
 
Digital natives, Types of Internet-users, Internet-use index and other socio-
demographic characteristics 
 
In this report, the special focus will be on younger Europeans, who were born and 
raised with the Internet: ‘digital natives’. The reason for this focus is twofold. On the 
one hand, tomorrow’s citizens may well have different views of and approaches to the 
disclosure of personal information; on the other hand, younger people appear to tend 
to be unaware of privacy issues, or to prefer the short-term gains from providing 
personal data. The ease with which one individual can make available personal 
information about another is a challenge for personal data protection legislation.  
 
Besides age, other socio-demographic characteristics will also be addressed: gender, 
level of education, occupation, and socio-economic position.  
 
Further, in this report a distinction is made between two main types of Internet users, 
based on the type of websites they use: e-commerce sites (“online shoppers”) on the 
one hand and users of social networking sites and/or file-sharing sites on the other 
(together referred to in the report as “social networking site users”). E-commerce 
sites sell goods or services (e.g. travel, holiday, clothes, books, tickets, films, music, 
software, food). File-sharing sites are websites for sharing pictures, videos, movies, 
etc.  
 
An internet-use index has been developed for this study, based on how many of three 
types of websites are used by the interviewees: shopping sites, social networking 
sites, and file-sharing sites. The internet-use index can take the following values: -- 
(uses internet but none of those sites), - (uses one type), + (uses two types), ++ 
(uses all three types).

Outline of the report 
 
This report starts with an overview of respondents’ disclosure of personal 
information:, what information they consider to be personal, how necessary they 
believe it is to disclose personal information nowadays, their actual disclosure, the 
risks they associate with it, and their attitudes towards their behaviour being recorded 
in daily life and towards profiling on the Internet. 
 
Chapter two focuses on how knowledgeable or aware Europeans are regarding 
disclosed personal information and their identity. It discusses their own identity 
management, i.e. the type of credentials they use, and identity protection, i.e the 
strategies and actions used to protect one's identity; Their knowledge of the personal 
data they have disclosed possibly being stored in databases that are accessible to 
other parties, the control they think they have over these personal data, and their 
experiences with and thoughts about identity theft and the possible loss of their 
personal data.  
 
Chapter three investigates Europeans’ views regarding the protection of personal 
data. Furthermore, Europeans’ expectations towards organisations that hold personal 
data, addressing their trust, concern, and wishes. The chapter ends by presenting 
Europeans’ own handling of personal data, that is, their willingness to pay for 
checking, amending or deleting their personal data, the importance of the portability 
of personal data when changing providers, and their handling of privacy settings on 
social networking sites.  
 
Chapter four discusses Europeans’ wishes regarding the regulation of personal data 
protection: the entity responsible for the safe handling of data, equal protection rights 
across the EU, preferred level of regulation, Data Protection Officers in companies, 
special DNA protection, minors, and police access to personal data.

This Eurobarometer survey has been commissioned by the Directorate-General 
JUSTICE, and the Directorate-General Information Society and Media (INFSO) and 
Directorate-General JRC. The questionnaire design, analysis and interpretation of the 
Special Eurobarometer n° 359 on “Attitudes on Data Protection and Electronic Identity 
in the European Union” were the result of the cooperation between TNS opinion and 
the eID team at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) of the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) in cooperation with DG JUST. 
 
The survey was conducted by TNS Opinion & Social network in the 27 Member States 
of the EU between end of November and mid-December 2010. 26,574 Europeans 
aged 15 and over were interviewed by interviewers from TNS Opinion & Social 
network. All interviews were conducted face-to-face in people’s homes and in the 
appropriate national languages. The methodology used is that of the Standard 
Eurobarometer surveys of the Directorate-General Communication (“Research and 
Speechwriting” Unit). A technical note concerning the interviews, carried out by the 
institutes within the TNS Opinion & Social network, is annexed to this report. This 
note specifies the interview method used, as well as the confidence intervals2. 
 
In this report, we analyse the results at three levels: the average for the 27 Member 
States, the national average, and when relevant, the differences according to the 
socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. The general analysis and the 
socio-demographic analysis are based on the EU27 results, that is to say the average 
of the results for the 27 Member States. The average is weighted to reflect the actual 
population of each of the Member States. 
 
 
The Eurobarometer web site can be consulted at the following address: 
http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/index_en.htm 
 
We would like to take the opportunity to thank all the respondents across Europe who 
have given their time to take part in this survey.  
Without their active participation, this study would not have been possible.

1 PERSONAL DATA DISCLOSURE IN EVERYDAY LIFE 
 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
The disclosure of personal information appears to have become an increasingly 
common part of everyday life. Such disclosure can be open and deliberate in some 
cases, such as on social networking sites or in exchange for services. However it can 
also be unintentional and hidden, for example when behaviour is being tracked 
through websites, mobile phones or credit cards. 
 
This chapter examines Europeans’ disclosure of personal information: what they 
consider to be personal information, how necessary they think it is to disclose such 
information on the Internet, how often they actually disclose various types of personal 
information and for what purposes. The chapter ends with a discussion of the risks of 
the disclosure of personal information as perceived by respondents and their opinions 
about having their behaviour recorded and about profiling on the Internet.  
 
Throughout the chapter a distinction will be made between opinions of Europeans in 
general and opinions of European Internet users. Further refined distinction within the 
latter group will be made between users of social networking sites and file-sharing 
sites on the one hand and activities that involve purchasing or shopping on the other.  
 
Internet use will be discussed later in this chapter in greater detail. Here, a concise 
description of Internet use may be helpful for the reader in providing a context for the 
survey results on disclosure of personal information. Almost two-thirds of respondents 
use the Internet, with majorities occurring in some northern EU Member States and 
smaller numbers in southern and central European countries.  
 
For every ten European Internet users, six visit shopping sites to purchase goods or 
services online, such as travel, holiday, clothes, books, tickets, film, music, software, 
or food; slightly over half use a social networking site; and more than four use 
websites to share pictures, videos, movies, and the like. Shopping online is most 
common in the northern and western countries, and least in the southern and central 
EU Member States. These countries instead show the highest rates of sharing site 
use.

1.2 Disclosing personal information 
 
1.2.1 Information considered as personal  
 
– Medical information, financial information and identity numbers are regarded 
as personal information by more than seven Europeans in ten – 
 
All respondents were asked which information and data they consider to be personal3. 
Around three-quarters of the European interviewees think that the following are 
personal: financial information, such as salary, bank details and credit record (75%), 
medical information such as patient records, health information (74%), and their 
national identity number and / or card number or passport number (73%). A majority 
say that fingerprints (64%), home address (57%) and mobile phone number (53%) 
are personal. 
 
Almost half of the Europeans surveyed consider photos of them (48%), and their 
name (46%) as personal. Close to a third think so of their work history (30%) and 
who their friends are (30%). Around a quarter of respondents also think that 
information about their tastes and opinions (27%), their nationality (26%), things 
they do, such as hobbies, sports, places they go (25%), and the websites they visit 
(25%) is personal.

3 QB2 Which of the following types of information and data that are related to you do you consider as 
personal?  
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 13 - 
1.2.1.1 Financial information  
 
- Financial information is more likely to be considered as personal by Internet users 
who shop online - 
 
Three-quarters of European respondents consider financial information, such as 
salary, bank details, and credit record, to be personal. This was the most cited item in 
eight Member States: Denmark (91%), the Netherlands, Luxembourg (both 90%), 
Finland (88%), the United Kingdom (87%), Malta (83%), Spain (75%) and Italy 
(70%). It was also the first mentioned item in Germany (87%), equal with medical 
information, and in Cyprus (70%), where it was equal with fingerprints. 
 
Countries which also have large majorities for this opinion are Ireland (89%), Finland, 
Slovenia (88%), Slovakia, Sweden, the Czech Republic, (each 82%), France, Belgium 
(each 81%), and Latvia and Estonia (both 79%).  
 
In contrast, in Poland (44%) and Romania (46%) fewer than half of the respondents 
think that financial information is personal. 
 
In general, countries from north-west Europe are more likely to consider financial 
information to be personal. 
 
It is also interesting to note that the countries where Internet users are more likely to 
consider that financial information is personal also have higher proportions of 
respondents who shop online. For instance, 81% of Internet users in Denmark 
purchase online and 91% of Danish respondents considered financial information as 
personal. Conversely, only 21% of the Internet users in Bulgaria shop online and 55% 
say that financial information is personal. The understanding and perception of what 
is personal information seems to vary, to a certain extent, according to the online 
activities that are more frequently pursued in each Member State.  
 
 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

Base: Whole sample 
 
Socio-demographic analysis reveals that the highest proportions of respondents 
who consider financial information as personal are found among the better educated, 
i.e. till the age of 20 or beyond (81%), managers (84%), and other white collar 
workers (80%). 
 
The proportion is lowest among the youngest respondents aged 15-24 (71%), 
interviewees whose education ended at the age of 15 or younger (70%), the 
unemployed (68%), students (70%), respondents who have difficulties paying their 
bills most of the time (69%), and people low on the social scale (70%). 
 
Internet users are more likely than non-users Internet to consider financial 
information to be personal: 81% of those using the Internet every day compared to 
70% of non-users.  
 
There is also a clear correlation between online purchasing and regarding financial 
information as personal. 85% of those who shop online say this information is 
personal, compared with 73% of those who do not purchase online.

1.2.1.2 Medical information  
 
A large majority of the European interviewees also see medical information, such as 
patient records and health information, as personal. This answer comes first in five 
Member States: Ireland (93%), Slovenia (90%), Sweden (89%), Belgium (84%), and 
France (82%). In Austria, the same number of respondents considered medical 
information and home address as personal (75%).  
 
Vast majorities of respondents who believe that medical information is personal are 
also found in the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark (each 87%), the Netherlands 
(86%), Slovakia (84%), the United Kingdom (83%), Estonia (81%), Finland (80%), 
Malta (79%) and Latvia (77%).  
 
Countries where only around half of the respondents think so are Poland (46%), 
Portugal and Romania (each 50%) and Bulgaria (52%).  
 
Again, the respondents located in the north and west of the European Union are most 
likely to regard medical information as personal.

collar workers (78%).  
 
The lowest percentages are recorded among interviewees whose education ended at 
fifteen or earlier (67%), house persons (68%), respondents who have difficulties with 
paying bills most of the time (69%) and people low on the social scale (70%).  
 
Respondents who use the Internet are again more likely to consider medical 
information to be personal: 80% compared with only 68% of non-Internet users.

1.2.1.3 National identity number, identity card number or passport number 
 
Almost three-quarters of the European interviewees, and a majority in each single 
Member State, consider their national identity number, identity card number or 
passport number as personal information.  
 
This answer comes first in ten Member States: Bulgaria (92%), the Czech Republic 
(90%), Slovakia (89%), Latvia (86%), Estonia (85%), Lithuania (82%), Greece, 
Romania (both 81%), Portugal (73%) and Hungary (69%). 
 
Denmark (89%), Finland (85%), Poland (84%), Ireland and Sweden (each 81%) also 
have high proportions of respondents citing this item.  
 
The lowest percentages – though still representing a majority - are recorded in Malta 
(53%), France (54%), and Belgium (58%). 
 
Respondents in countries in the north and the east of the European Union are more 
likely to say that national identity documents/ numbers are personal information than 
those in the west and the south. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

Socio-demographic analysis reveals that some groups are less likely to consider 
their national identity number, identity card number or passport number as personal: 
those who left school at fifteen or younger (68%), retired respondents (67%), and 
those who never use the Internet (67%).  
 
Conversely, groups that are more likely to consider this information as personal are 
the respondents aged 25-39, interviewees with highest education, managers (each 
77%) and other white collar workers (76%).  
 
Respondents who have almost never difficulties in paying their bills and for 
respondents who position themselves higher on the social scale are also more likely to 
consider financial and medical information personal information.

Other information 
 
When we consider other items listed, considerable differences between countries and 
between socio-demographic profiles emerge: 
 
Your fingerprints 
 
This answer comes first in only one country, Cyprus (70%), equal with financial 
information. This answer is also given by high proportion of respondents in Greece 
(77%), Germany (76%), and Bulgaria and the UK (both 73%). In only two countries 
do fewer than half of respondents regard this as personal information: Italy (49%) 
and Finland (46%).  
 
Your home address 
 
In Austria, this item was chosen in joint first place with medical information (75%). 
More than seven out of ten respondents in the UK and in Poland also select this 
answer. 
In five countries, fewer than 40% of the respondents give this answer: Sweden 
(39%), Denmark (36%), Romania (35%), Cyprus (34%) and Finland (32%). 
 
Your name 
 
There are considerable differences between Member States for this item. In Poland, 
where this is the first answer selected, 84% of respondents say that their name is 
personal information. In all other Member States fewer than 70% of the respondents 
consider names as personal. Nevertheless, a high proportion of respondents in Austria 
(66%), the UK (58%) and Ireland (57%) cite this item. Proportions are much lower in 
Denmark, Cyprus (both 23%), in Finland and in Malta (both 22%). 
 
It is interesting to note that there is a correlation between names and home 
addresses: respondents who say that their names are personal information are more 
likely to believe that their home addresses are too. 
 
Your mobile phone number 
 
A high proportion of respondents in Germany, the UK and Austria (all 65%) say that 
mobile numbers are personal information. This is less the case in Romania (28%) and 
in Finland (33%). 
 
Photos of you   
 
Respondents in northern and western Member States are much more inclined to 
consider photos as personal information than those in eastern Member States. This 
item was cited by 67% respondents in Germany, 58% in Austria, 57% in Ireland and 
55% in the UK, but by only 19% of respondents in Romania and 28% in Bulgaria. 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 20 - 
An analysis of socio-demographic variables shows that in general the more educated 
respondents and respondents who have a higher occupational status are more likely 
to regard photos as personal information. 
 
It is also interesting to note that the Internet users who use social networking sites or 
file-sharing sites are less likely to consider photos as personal information. Indeed, 
51% of social networking site users and 50% of file-sharing site users say that they 
are personal information compared with 57% of non-users in both cases. Conversely, 
online shoppers are more likely than non-online shoppers to believe that photos are 
personal information (58% vs. 48%).  
 
The same pattern as for photos emerges for nationality, tastes and opinions, the 
identity of friends and the things they do; It appears that file-sharing site users and 
social networking site users are less likely to find that information personal than 
internet users who do not use those sites.

1.2.2 Perception of the necessity of disclosing personal information 
   
- Disclosing personal information is an increasing part of Europeans’ lives and a 
subject of concern for most - 
 
Turning now to public perceptions of the necessity of disclosing personal information, 
respondents were asked to what extent they agree or disagree with seven statements 
addressing this issue5. The general finding is that while disclosing personal 
information has become a frequent activity in Europeans’ lives, it remains a big issue 
for most of them.  
 
Three-quarters of the Europeans interviewed agree that disclosing personal 
information is an increasing part of modern life (74%); around six out of ten 
respondents say they agree that the government of their country of residence asks 
them for more and more personal information (64%), that nowadays one needs to log 
into several systems using several usernames and passwords (60%), and that there 
is no alternative than to disclose personal information if one wants to obtain products 
or services (58%). 
 
Interestingly, around a third of the interviewees indicate that disclosing personal 
information is not a big issue for them (33%), that they do not mind disclosing 
personal information in return for free services online, such as a free email address 
(29%), or that they feel obliged to disclose personal information on the Internet 
(28%).

1.2.2.1 Disclosing personal information is an increasing part of modern life  
 
Close to three-quarters of the Europeans interviewed agree (‘totally’ or ‘tend to’ 
agree) that disclosing personal information is an increasing part of modern life. This 
view is supported most strongly in Denmark (90%), Greece (88%), Sweden (84%), 
Cyprus 83%), the United Kingdom, Spain, Finland, Ireland (all 82%), and Italy 
(80%).  
Considerably lower percentages of respondents agreeing with this statement are 
found in Romania (47%), Hungary (55%), Malta (57%), and Luxembourg (59%). 
However, a majority of respondents in every Member States agree with the 
statement. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
 
 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 24 - 
A socio-demographic breakdown shows that the highest percentages of 
respondents agreeing with this statement are generally found in the younger age 
groups aged 15-24 (82%) and 25-39 (80%), the better educated (79%), students 
(83%), managers (81%), other white collar workers (79%), interviewees living in 
households with three persons or more (both 79%), and respondents with Internet-
use index ‘++’ (85%). 
 
Everyday Internet users (81%) are much more likely to believe that this is an 
increasing part of modern life than those who never use the Internet (68%). 
 
 
1.2.2.2 The government asks for more and more personal information 
 
More than six Europeans out of ten interviewed agree (‘totally’ or ‘tend to’ agree) that 
the government of their country of residence asks them for more and more personal 
information (64%). Member States where most respondents agreed with this 
statement are Greece (83%), and Germany and Italy (both 76%). Conversely, the 
lowest numbers of respondents who agree were recorded in Luxembourg (34%), 
Malta (39%), Sweden, Estonia (both 40%), Lithuania (42%), Romania (43%), Latvia 
(44%) and Finland (45%).

A socio-demographic analysis shows that agreement with this statement is most 
likely among the self-employed (71%), white collar workers, respondents who have 
difficulties paying their bills from time to time (both 69%), and respondents with 
Internet-use index ‘++’ (70%).  
 
 
1.2.2.3 Nowadays one needs to log into several systems using several 
usernames and passwords 
 
Six in ten of the Europeans interviewed (60%) agree with the statement that 
nowadays one needs to log into several systems using several usernames and 
passwords. A high proportion of respondents answered that it was not applicable to 
them (16%). If we exclude those respondents, the proportion who agrees rises to 
71%.  
 
Member States where the vast majority of respondents agree with this statement are 
Finland, Denmark (both 85%), Sweden (83%), the Netherlands (82%) and Germany 
(78%). In contrast, only relative majorities supporting this view are found in Romania 
(40%), Poland (42%), Portugal (43%), Bulgaria, Spain (both 45%), and Lithuania 
(47%). 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

A socio-demographic analysis reveals striking differences regarding this statement 
between several groups in terms of age, education, and Internet-use index. 
 
The younger the respondents are, the more they are likely to agree with the 
statement: 80% of the 15-24 aged group compared with 39% of those who are 55 
and over. 75% of the respondents who studied until the age of 20 or later agree with 
the statement, compared with only 34% of those who finished their education before 
the age of 16. 
 
Nearly nine out of ten respondents who can be classified as ‘++’ on the Internet-use 
index say that they need to log into several systems using several usernames and 
passwords, compared with only 34% of those who are classified as ‘--‘, i.e those who 
neither shop online nor use social networking sites or sharing websites.

1.2.2.3  There is no alternative than to disclose personal information if one 
wants to obtain products or services 
 
Close to six in ten of the Europeans interviewed (58%) agree (‘totally’ or ‘tend to’ 
agree) that there is no alternative than to disclose personal information if one wants 
to obtain products or services. This opinion is shared by most respondents in the 
Czech Republic and Finland (both 70%); the proportions are lowest in Romania 
(33%), Lithuania (38%), Hungary (44%), Portugal (45%) and Slovenia (47%). In 
Romania (36%) and in Lithuania (41%), a relative majority of respondents even think 
that there is alternative to disclosing personal information. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 28 - 
A socio-demographic analysis of this statement shows that agreement is strongest 
among the youngest respondents aged 15-24 (69%), students (67%), managers 
(66%) and other white collar workers (65%). 
Education is also a discriminating factor: 63% of the respondents who studied until 
the age of 20 or later agreed with the statement, compared with only 47% of those 
who finished school before the age of 16. 
The use of the Internet has also a significant impact on the data. Everyday Internet 
users are more likely to think that there is no alternative than to disclose personal 
information than non-Internet users (67% vs. 45%). 
Among Internet users, those who shop online or use social networking and sharing 
sites tend to agree with the statement more than those who do not. For instance, 
71% of online shoppers think that there is no alternative compared with only 59% of 
those who do not buy online.

is a big issue for them. Only one third of respondents (33%) say that disclosing 
personal information is not a big issue for them.  
 
The highest percentages of respondents saying that it is not a big issue are found in 
Denmark (51%), Estonia (47%), Lithuania (46%), Sweden (45%) and Poland (44%).

A socio-demographic breakdown again reveals significantly more frequent 
agreement with this statement among the youngest respondents, those aged 15-24 
(43%), and students (42%).  
Once more, there is an interesting divide on this question among Internet users. 
Internet users who use social networking (38%) or sharing sites (40%) are more 
likely to say that disclosing personal information is not a big issue than Internet users 
who do not use those sites (29% and 30% respectively).  
There are no differences between those who shop online and those who do not.

free services online, such as a free email address. Nevertheless, less than three out of 
ten European respondents (29%) do not mind disclosing  
 
Italy (56%) stands out with the highest percentage of respondents who take this 
view, followed at some distance by Denmark (36%). Conversely, the lowest 
percentages are recorded in Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Greece (each 15%).

1.3.1 Type of personal information disclosed on the Internet:  
 social networking or sharing sites versus online shopping 
 
- Name, photo and nationality are the information disclosed by the largest number of 
social networking and sharing sites users – 
 
The reader may recall that 66% of European interviewees use the Internet, 39% shop 
online, 34% use social networking sites, and 29% use sharing sites for pictures, 
videos and/or movies. The respondents who engaged in these activities were asked 
which types of personal information they had previously disclosed6. This section 
distinguishes between social networking or sharing sites on the one hand and 
shopping on the other.  
 
Almost eight out of ten respondents who use social networking or sharing sites, 
revealed their name on the Internet (79%). Around half of them disclosed photos of 
themselves (51%), or their nationality (47%). Almost four in ten disclosed the things 
they do (for example hobbies, sports, places they go), their home address, and who 
their friends are (all three 39%). One-third shared their tastes and opinions (33%) 
and a quarter gave their mobile phone number (23%).  
 
Fewer respondents disclosed their work history (18%), the websites they visit (14%), 
their national identity number, identity card number, or passport number (13%), 
financial information such as salary, bank details and credit record (10%), medical 
information such as patient record and health information (5%) and fingerprints 
(3%).

their mobile phone number (46%), and a third their nationality (35%) or financial 
information such as salary, bank details and credit record (33%). Almost one in five

Photos are next mentioned, in particular in the United Kingdom (67%), Denmark, 
Sweden (64%), and Malta (61%) 
Nationality is disclosed most often in 12 other countries, notably Malta (78%), 
Sweden (68%), Luxembourg (66%), and Denmark (65%); the respondent’s home

A country-by-country analysis of personal information disclosed when shopping 
online shows that in each of the Member States, the respondent’s name and home 
address are the two types of personal information disclosed most often. Internet 
shoppers in the Netherlands (98%), Denmark, Sweden (both 96%), Slovenia and 
Finland (both 95%) are the most likely to have given their name; in the Netherlands 
(96%), Malta, Finland (both 95%), the Czech Republic and Sweden (both 94%) their 
home address. 
 
Further, Internet shoppers who revealed their mobile phone number are found most 
often in Sweden (76%), Denmark, 73%), the Czech Republic, Latvia, and Slovakia 
(all 71%); their nationality most frequently in Malta (74%), Austria (60%), and 
Ireland (56%); their financial information mostly in Denmark (56%), Luxembourg 
(47%), France (44%) and Ireland (41%); and their national identity number, identity 
card number or passport number most often in Sweden (72%), Latvia (57%), Spain 
(51%) and Estonia (47%).  
 
 
A general pattern emerges from the socio-demographic analysis of the types of 
personal information disclosed on social networking or sharing sites.  
 
The younger the social or sharing site users are, the more likely they are to disclose 
their names (85%), their photos (65%), their nationality (54%), the things they do 
(50%), who their friends are (51%) etc. What is interesting to underline here is that 
they are less likely than respondents who are aged 25-54 to consider this information 
as personal. 
 
To a lesser extent, educational level has an impact on the disclosure of such data. 
Respondents with a high level of education are more likely to disclose their photos 
(49%), their nationality (47%), the things they do (38%), who their friends are 
(37%). Names are disclosed by more social networking or sharing site users who 
have a middle level of education (79%). 
More educated respondents are more likely to consider this information as personal. 
 
 
The socio-demographic analysis of personal information disclosed when shopping 
online does not yield a regular general pattern of the kind we have seen in the case of 
social networking. Indeed, there are few differences by socio-demographics variables.  
 
However, education does seem to play a role in the disclosure of some information. 
Online shoppers who studied until the age 20 or later are more likely to disclose home 
address (91%), financial information (36%), mobile phone number (49%) than those 
who finished school before the age of 16 (respectively 83%, 28%, 37%). 
Nevertheless, these differences are not really significant. 
 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 45 - 
Finally, it is interesting to note that the fact that a given type of information is 
regarded as personal does not have a real impact on whether this information is 
disclosed. For instance, 51% of social networking or sharing site users who say that 
photos are personal information nevertheless disclose their photos, compared to 50% 
of those who do not regard photos as personal information.  
 
This pattern is the same for most information for both social networking site users 
and online shoppers. The only exceptions are to be found among online shoppers, 
with respect of two types of information; Over a third (35%) of online shoppers who 
say that financial information is personal disclosed such information, compared with 
only 21% of those who do not consider it as personal; Four in ten (40%) respondents 
who say that their nationality is personal disclosed it, compared to only 33% of those 
who do not consider it as personal. 
 
 
 
1.3.2 Reasons for disclosure: social networking or sharing sites versus 
online shopping   
 
–Accessing the service is the main reason for disclosing information for social 
networking / sharing site users and online shoppers – 
 
The previous section described the types of personal information respondents had 
previously disclosed on the Internet. This section presents the reasons given for 
disclosing personal information on the Internet7. As in the previous section, a 
distinction is made between online purchasing on the one hand and social networking 
and sharing sites on the other.  
 
The two main reasons given by respondents for the disclosure of information when 
using social networking or sharing sites are to access the service (61%) and to 
connect with others (52%). Around one-fifth of the respondents do so for fun (22%), 
to obtain a service adapted to their needs (18%), or to get a service for free (18%).

The most important reason for disclosing personal information when shopping 
online is mentioned by a vast majority of the online shoppers: to access the service 
(79%). This reason is followed at some distance by to obtain a service adapted to 
their needs (27%), and to save time at the next visit (19%).

social networking or sharing sites shows that to access the service is the most 
important reason in 21 Member States, most frequently mentioned in Sweden (79%), 
Cyprus (76%) and Ireland (75%). In six other Member States, to connect with others 
is the most important reason: Luxembourg (70%), the Netherlands 65%), Germany 
(62%), the United Kingdom (61%), Lithuania (59%), Greece (57%).

The most important reason for disclosing personal information when shopping 
online in every Member State is to access the service, in particular in Sweden (94%), 
Germany (92%), Latvia (90%), and the Netherlands (89%). The second most 
important reason in 20 Member States is to obtain a service adapted to your needs, 
mentioned most frequently in Lithuania (44%), Germany (43%), Malta (42%), and 
Bulgaria (40%); to save time at the next visit in five Member States, namely Ireland 
(34%), Romania (29%), Denmark (27%), the Netherlands and the United Kingdom 
(both 21%); and to benefit from personalised commercial offers in Greece (49%) and 
Portugal (29%).

Portugal, and Romania. For precise numbers, readers should refer to the annexes. 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

When looking at socio-demographic variables for social networking and sharing 
sites, we can observe few differences between categories. ‘To access the service’ is 
indeed the first reason for disclosing information in all categories. 
 
Nevertheless, the younger social networking and sharing site users (15-24) are more 
likely to say that they disclose information to connect with others (57%) and for fun 
(26%) than older users. 43% and 17% of those who are aged over 55 mention these 
two reasons respectively. 
 
The socio-demographic analysis for shopping online reveals also few differences. 
 
 
1.3.3 Over-disclosure 
 
1.3.3.1 Incidence of over-disclosure 
 
- Half or nearly half of social networking or file-sharing site users and online shoppers 
have already been exposed to over-disclosure on the Internet – 
 
Respondents who use the Internet were asked whether they had ever been required 
to provide more personal information than necessary to obtain access to or to use an 
online service, for example when registering for an online game or an online 
information service, purchasing goods online, or opening an account with a social 
networking site8.  
 
More than four in ten (43%) report they were required to provide more personal 
information than necessary, though only 5% always feel so and 38% say it happens 
sometimes. By contrast, over half of the interviewees (53%) seldom or never 
experience such forced disclosure: 32% say never and 21% say rarely. 
 
                                          
8 QB22 Have you ever been required to provide more personal information than necessary to obtain 
access to or to use an online service (e.g. when registering for an online game or an online

The largest percentages of respondents who felt they were always or sometimes 
required to provide more personal information than necessary when obtaining access 
to or using an online service are recorded in Portugal (56%), Spain (54%), Italy, 
Hungary (both 53%), Greece (49%), Ireland (50%). With the exception of Ireland, 
these are all southern EU Member States. In every other single Member State the 
number of Internet users who did not or rarely encounter such an experience exceeds 
the number of Internet users who sometimes or always did. This is most clearly 
visible in Finland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Sweden and Estonia, which are all northern 
countries.

From a socio-demographic point of view, age and education again make a difference. 
Younger Internet users are more likely to have been exposed to over-disclosure on 
the Internet: this affects 48% of the 25-39 age group and 46% of the 15-24s but 
only 32% of the 55+ group. Education is also a discriminating factor: 45% of the 
Internet users who have the highest level of education have experienced over-
disclosure on the Internet, compared with only 37% of those who have the lowest 
level of education. In addition, managers and unemployed stand out with highest 
percentages (both 49%) reporting over-disclosure. 
 
Analysis of the type of Internet-users reveals the following: 
? Half of Internet users who share pictures, videos or movies (50%) have been 
required to disclose more personal information than necessary, compared with 
only 37% of other users; 
? Nearly half of social networkers (49%) have been exposed to over-disclosure. 
compared with 37% of Internet users who do not use social networking sites; 
? 46% of online shoppers vs. 38% of Internet users who do not shop online.

1.3.3.2 Concern about over-disclosure 
 
- A vast majority of Internet users exposed to over-disclosure express concerns – 
 
Those interviewees who had always or sometimes experienced unnecessary disclosure 
of personal information when obtaining access to or using an online service were then 
asked how concerned they were about such cases9. Seven in ten of these respondents 
were very or fairly concerned (72%), whereas just over a quarter were not very or 
not at all concerned (27%).  
 
 
Base: Respondents who always or sometimes experienced unnecessary disclosure (28% of whole sample)  
 
In all but three Member States the respondents who are very or fairly concerned 
about the unnecessary disclosure of personal information clearly outnumber the 
respondents who are not very or not at all concerned, especially in Ireland (83% 
versus 16%), Luxembourg (also 83% versus 16%), Greece, Portugal (both 82% 
versus 18%), the Czech Republic (80% versus 20%) and the United Kingdom (80% 
versus 19%).  
 
The only exceptions to this pattern are Sweden (33% versus 66%) and two countries 
with a fifty-fifty situation: the Netherlands (49% versus 51%) and Malta (51% versus 
49%).

Base: Respondents who always or sometimes experienced unnecessary disclosure (28% of whole sample)  
 
A socio-demographic analysis reveals that concern about unnecessary disclosure of 
personal information in order to obtain an online service is least frequent among 
respondents aged 15-24 and students, which is in accordance with the findings 
described in the previous sections; nonetheless, even in these groups concerned 
respondents constitute a majority (62% and 58% respectively) of those who had 
experienced unnecessary disclosure of personal information. 
 
Concern is found most often among older respondents aged 40-54 (77%) and 55+ 
(79%), managers (79%), and interviewees who have difficulties with paying their bills 
most of the time (78%).  
 
Interestingly, concern about unnecessary disclosure appears to be inversely related to 
its incidence (presented in the preceding section): the lower the Internet-use index, 
the higher the concern: index ‘--’ (80%) compared to index ‘++’ (67%).

1.4 Attitudes toward disclosure of personal information 
 
1.4.1 Perceived risk factors associated with disclosure  
 
– More than half of online shoppers mention the risk of being victim of a fraud as 
a potential risk associated with disclosure – 
 
All respondents who use social networking or sharing sites or who shop online – 
whether or not they had previously disclosed personal information on the Internet – 
were then asked which three (out of ten) potential risks they associated with 
disclosure of personal information.10  
 
The ranking of respondents’ risk perceptions is the same for social networking or 
sharing sites as for shopping online, with the exception of being the victim of fraud: 
this item is the second most important risk associated with social networking but the 
most important risk in the case of shopping online (41% versus 55%).  
 
Around four in ten respondents, for both social networking and shopping, mention 
your information being used without your knowledge (44% and 43% respectively) 
and your information being shared with third parties without your agreement (38% 
and 43%); around one-third mention your identity being at risk of theft online (32% 
and 35%) and your information being used to send you unwanted commercial offers 
(28% and 34%); a quarter fear your information being used in different contexts 
from the ones where you disclosed it (25% and 27%).  
 
Other risks are mentioned less often, though more for social networking or sharing 
sites than for shopping online: your personal safety being at risk (20% and 12% 
respectively), your reputation being damaged (12% and 4%), your views and 
behaviours being misunderstood (11% and 4%), and discrimination against you in 
areas like recruitment, pricing, or availability of services (7% and 3%).

A country-by-country analysis of social networking or sharing site users reveals that 
the most frequent answer given in seventeen Member States is Your information 
being used without your knowledge: the highest scores for this item were recorded in 
Cyprus (72%), Romania (62%), Malta and Ireland (both 61%). 
In contrast, only 31% and 35% of social networking or sharing site users give this 
answer in Portugal and in the UK.  
 
Being a victim of fraud comes first in Portugal (56%), in Poland (53%), in Spain 
(52%), in the UK (49%), in France (47%) and in Estonia (45%).

When shopping online, being a victim of fraud is the risk of disclosure identified by 
the largest numbers of respondents in thirteen Member States. This result is 
exceptionally high in France, where 71% of online shoppers evoke this potential risk. 
It was also the risk most commonly identified in France by social networking or 
sharing site users. 
A high proportion of respondents also give this answer in Sweden (68%), the UK 
(65%) and Spain (60%). 
In Germany and in Austria, the risk most identified by social networking or sharing 
site users was also mentioned most often for online shopping: your information being 
shared with third parties without your agreement (59% and 54% respectively).

The socio-demographic analysis of perceptions of the risks associated with 
disclosing personal information when social networking shows that age, education 
and occupation all make a difference. Respondents aged 40-54 are more likely to 
mention the use of their information without their knowledge (48%) and their 
information being shared with third parties without their agreement (43%), whereas 
the oldest respondents (aged 55+) are more likely to mention their information being 
used to send them unwanted commercial offers (35%) and the risk of online identity 
theft (37%). This last item is also more often seen as a risk by respondents who left 
school at the age of 15 or younger (37%) than by those who remained longer in 
education. 
 
Turning to occupation, manual workers and house persons (both 45%) are most likely 
to report that they fear becoming a victim of fraud; managers and house persons 
(both 42%) are most likely to mention their information being shared with third 
parties without their agreement, compared to 34% of the students. Self-employed 
respondents (32%) more often cite the risk that their information may be used to 
send them unwanted commercial offers, and this item is also mentioned more 
frequently by retired respondents (36%), after the risk of identity theft (38%) and 
the use of their information without their knowledge (50%).

The socio-demographic analysis for shopping online reveals a similar pattern, 
though with fewer divergences. As in the case of social networking, respondents aged 
55+ (38%) are most likely to mention the use of their information to send them 
unwanted commercial offers. A similar pattern also applies to occupation: managers 
(47%) more often mention the risk that their information could be shared with third 
parties without their agreement, house persons (59%) are most likely cite the risk of 
fraud, while retired respondents (39%) identify the risk that their information may be 
used to send them unwanted commercial offers.

1.4.2 Concern about the recording of behaviour  
 
- A majority of social networking and sharing site users are not concerned about their 
behaviour being recorded on the Internet - 
 
The previous section presented risks that respondents associated with their activities 
on the Internet. This section puts those risks in the broader perspective of ‘real life’ 
by asking all interviewees – including those who do not use the Internet – how 
concerned they are in general about their behaviour being recording by cameras, 
payment cards and websites11.  
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
Around half of the interviewees are very or fairly concerned about their behaviour 
being recorded via payment cards (location and spending, 54%) and via mobile phone 
or mobile Internet (call content and geo-location, 49%).  
 
A relative majority of respondents are also worried about their behaviour being 
recorded on the Internet, including browsing, downloading files, accessing content 
online (40%). If we exclude the respondents who answered that this was “not 
applicable” to them (21%) – most probably because they do not use the Internet – an 
absolute majority say that they are worried about their data being recorded on the 
Internet (51%). 
 
                                          
11 QB13 Nowadays, cameras, cards and websites record your behaviour, for a range of reasons. Are you 
very concerned, fairly concerned, not very concerned or not at all concerned about your behaviour 
being recorded…? 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 65 - 
However, a relative or an absolute majority of respondents say that they are not 
concerned about their data being recorded via store or loyalty cards (48%), in a 
private space (54%) or in a public space (62%). Nevertheless, more than four in ten 
still worry about being recorded in a private space, such as a restaurant, bar, club, or 
office (41%), or having their preferences and consumption tracked via store or loyalty 
cards (40%). One-third are concerned about their behaviour being recorded in a 
public space, such as a street, subway, or airport (34%). In general, respondents are 
‘fairly’ rather than ‘very’ concerned. 
 
 
1.4.2.1 Payment cards: location and spending 
 
More than half of the respondents are concerned about their behaviour being tracked 
through payment cards. A country by country analysis reveals many differences. In 
nineteen Member States a majority of respondents said that this was a cause of 
concern, led by Greece (67%), the Czech Republic, France (both 64%), Ireland (63% 
and Germany (62%).   
However, a majority of respondents in eight Member States said that were 
unconcerned. This is especially the case in the Nordic countries: Sweden (62%), 
Finland and Denmark (each 60%), and in Estonia (59%). 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 66 - 
Few significant socio-demographic differences may be observed for the results of this 
question. Of all age groups, the youngest and the oldest (50% and 48% respectively) 
are least likely to be concerned about their behaviour being recorded via payment 
cards. This figure stands at 59% of the 40-54 age group and 56% of the 25-39s. This 
difference may be explained by the fact that these categories are more likely to use 
payment cards. 
 
 
1.4.2.2 Mobile phone or mobile Internet: call content and geolocation 
 
Close to half of the interviewees are concerned about being tracked via mobile phone 
or mobile Internet, i.e. through call content and geolocation. A majority of 
respondents say they are concerned in fifteen Member States, led by Greece (65%) 
and the Czech Republic (63%).  
In contrast, a majority are not worried in eleven Member States. The highest 
percentages were recorded in Sweden (69%) and Finland (64%), followed by 
Denmark (57%) and Estonia (56%).  
It is interesting to note that these are the same countries as those most concerned 
about data recorded via payment cards. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

Respondents in the 55+ age group (41%) are less likely to be concerned about 
tracking via mobile phones / mobile Internet than the younger age groups, the 
greatest difference being noted with those aged 25-39 (55%).  
 
However, this difference could be explained by the fact that 14% of the older 
respondents answered that this item was “not applicable” to them, most probably 
because they do not have mobile phones or mobile Internet access. 
 
Indeed, if the results are recalculated to exclude the respondents who said that it was 
not applicable, the ‘concerned’ result rises to 48%. Thus the difference between this 
and other age categories is lower. 
 
 
1.4.2.3 Internet: browsing, downloading files, accessing content online  
 
Four out of ten Europeans surveyed are concerned about their behaviour being 
recorded through the Internet when browsing, downloading files, and accessing 
content online.  
 
In a majority of Member States (fourteen), the majority of respondents are not 
concerned about their behaviour being recorded on the Internet, in particular in 
Sweden (71% vs. 20% who are concerned), Estonia (48% vs. 24%), and the 
Netherlands (57% vs. 38%). Romania also has a large relative majority of 
respondents who are not concerned (34% vs. 15%) but with exceptionally high “not 
applicable” (34%) and “don’t know” rates (17%).  
 
In thirteen other Member States, this is a matter of concern for a majority of 
respondents. The countries in which respondents are most concerned are Germany 
(53% vs. 31% who are not concerned), France (49% vs. 31%) and Ireland (49% vs. 
25%).

In general, at first sight, there seems to be only a weak relationship between the 
number of active Internet users in a country and the number of respondents who are 
concerned about the recording of their behaviour, with the more active Internet users 
the more concerned.  
 
However, this relationship becomes more apparent when three countries with an 
exceptional ratio of Internet-users / concern are excluded from the analysis: 
Germany, France (both with relatively small numbers of active Internet users, but 
high levels of concern), and Sweden (the opposite, namely a relatively high number 
of Internet users, but lower concern levels).  
 
 
1.4.2.4 Private space: restaurants, bars, clubs, or offices  
 
A majority of Europeans interviewed (54%) are not concerned about their behaviour 
being recorded in private spaces such as restaurants, bars, clubs and offices.  
A country-by-country analysis shows that this is the case in 21 Member States. Once 
again, concern is lowest in the three Nordic countries: 80% of respondents in 
Sweden, 73% in Finland and 72% in Denmark are not concerned about their 
behaviour being recorded in a private space. 
In a few Member States, a small majority of respondents say that this is a concern, in 
particular in Germany (54%) and the Czech Republic (53%).

A majority of Europeans are not concerned about behaviour being recorded via store 
or loyalty cards (48%). A majority of respondents in 22 Member States are not 
concerned by it. Again, the three Nordic countries are the least concerned: 78% of 
respondents in Sweden, 70% in Finland and 68% in Denmark are not concerned by 
this, along with 68% in Estonia and 67% in the Netherlands. 
Conversely, in five countries a majority of respondents are concerned about this 
issue. These countries are Greece (57% vs. 28%), the Czech Republic (52% vs. 
38%), Germany (48% vs. 44%), Portugal (45% vs. 39%) and Ireland (45% vs. 
44%).

respondents aged 55+ (37%). 44% of the respondents aged 40-54 say they are 
concerned. 
The analysis of other socio-demographic variables shows few differences. 
 
 
1.4.2.6 Public space: streets, subways, airports 
 
A majority of Europeans are not concerned about their behaviour being recorded in a 
public space (62%). Greece is the only country where a majority of respondents are 
concerned about this issue (54%). Conversely, three-quarters or more of Europeans 
are unconcerned in Sweden (87%), Finland (79%), Denmark (78%), the Netherlands 
(77%), Estonia (76%) and Latvia (75%). Again, respondents in the Nordic and Baltic 
countries are less likely to be concerned about having their behaviour recorded than 
interviewees in other Member States.

- 73 - 
Few socio-demographic differences are found regarding the recording of behaviour in 
public spaces.  
 
Finally, it is interesting to note that the countries can be grouped according to their 
levels of concern. In the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland and Denmark), the Baltic 
States (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia), Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Romania and 
Bulgaria, an absolute or a relative majority of respondents are not concerned about 
their behaviour being recorded in most of the places analysed above. This means 
that, in these countries, a majority of respondents are unconcerned by all or at least 
five out of six of the situations listed. 
 
However, in Greece, a majority of respondents say that they are concerned by all six 
situations analysed. Greece can be grouped with Germany, Czech Republic, Belgium, 
Ireland, France, Luxembourg and Portugal, countries where a majority of respondents 
are concerned about their behaviour being recorded in four or five of the places listed.

1.4.3 Attitudes towards profiling on Internet 
 
- A majority of Internet users are uncomfortable about profiling on the Internet - 
 
Four in ten Europeans are concerned about their behaviour being tracked on the 
Internet, as the reader may recall from the preceding section. This section goes into 
more detail about this issue. Some Internet companies are able to provide free search 
engines or free e-mail accounts thanks to the income they receive from advertisers 
trying to reach users on their websites. Respondents were asked how comfortable 
they are with the fact that those websites use information about their online activity 
to tailor advertisements or content to their hobbies and interests.  
 
More than half of the Europeans interviewed feel uncomfortable (54%) with Internet 
profiling, whereas four in ten are comfortable with it (39%).  
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample)  
 
Countries where two-thirds or more of respondents feel uncomfortable are the Czech 
Republic (72%), Germany (69%), Greece (68%), and Latvia (67%).   
The lowest percentages are found in Bulgaria (30%), Poland (34%), Romania and 
Ireland (both 40%).  
 
In all but seven of the Member States the number of respondents feeling 
uncomfortable is larger than the number of respondents feeling comfortable with 
Internet profiling. These exceptions are Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Ireland, Italy, 
Finland, Portugal and the United Kingdom.   
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 75 - 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample)  
 
Social networking and sharing sites users are much more comfortable about profiling 
on the Internet.  
A relative majority of social networkers feel comfortable (48% vs. 47%) whereas 60% 
of Internet users who do not use social networks feel uncomfortable. 
47% of sharing site users feel comfortable (vs. 48% who do not) whereas 58% of 
Internet users who do not use these sites feel uncomfortable about it. 
Conversely, the fact of purchasing online has no impact on the results: 60% of online 
shoppers feel uncomfortable with Internet profiling.

1.5 Internet use 
 
1.5.1 How often and where? 
 
– Around two-thirds of Europeans use the Internet – 
 
This section sketches the role the Internet plays in Europeans’ everyday lives. 
Respondents were asked how often they use the Internet at home, at work, or 
somewhere other than home or work (school, university, cyber-café etc.)12. A 
majority of the Europeans interviewed use the Internet at home (62%), over a 
quarter (28%) access the Internet at work and one fifth (22%) does so somewhere 
else.   
 
More than four in ten Europeans surveyed use the Internet at home on an (almost) 
everyday basis (44%). Other respondents do so less often: one to three times a week 
(15%), or at most three times a month (3%). A quarter of the respondents never use 
the Internet at home (25%) and the remaining interviewees do not have home access 
(13%). 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
The Internet is used less frequently at work: (almost) every day (20%), one to three 
times a week (5%), or at most three times a month (3%). More than half of 
respondents say they never use the Internet at work (53%) and almost one in five do 
not have Internet access in the work place (19%).  
 
                                          
12 D62. Could you tell me if …? 1. You use the Internet at home, in your home; 2. You use the Internet on 
your place of work. 3 Somewhere else (school, university, cyber-café, etc.) 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 77 - 
 
 Base: Whole sample 
 
Turning now to Internet usage at places other than home or work, such as 
schools, universities, or cyber-cafés, a majority of respondents (66%) never use the 
Internet at such places, while more than one in ten (12%) say they have no Internet 
access. Only small minorities appear to use the Internet at places other than home or 
work: on an (almost) everyday basis (5%), one to three times a week (7%), or at 
most three times a month (10%).  
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
A country-by-country analysis reveals that four countries stand out clearly with the 
highest rates of Internet use at home, at work, and elsewhere: the Netherlands 
(94%, 55%, and 40% respectively), Sweden (90%, 55%, 42%), Denmark (88%, 
54%, 41%), and Finland (78%, 41%, 34%).  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 78 - 
In contrast, countries where fewer than half of respondents use the Internet at home, 
at work or elsewhere are Portugal (35%, 18%, and 14% respectively), Greece (38%, 
17%, 14%), Romania (39%, 15%, 17%), Cyprus (43%, 17%, 15%), Bulgaria (43%, 
21%, 15%),) and (Hungary (48%, 21%, 19%). 
 
In general, northern and western European countries record a higher rate of Internet 
use than those located in the south and the east. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 79 - 
Several differences appear in terms of socio demographic characteristics, in 
particular regarding age, education, occupation, financial situation, self-positioning on 
the social scale, household composition, and marital status; and to a lesser extent, 
gender. Younger and the better educated respondents record the highest rate of 
Internet use. Students, managers, and other white collar workers use the Internet 
most often, as do interviewees who place themselves high on the social scale, 
respondents without financial problems and people living in larger rather than smaller 
households. Slightly more men than women use the Internet.

1.5.2 Shopping, social networking, and sharing sites 
 
– A majority of Internet users purchase online  
and use social networking sites – 
 
Internet users were asked which activities they undertook on the Internet13. A 
majority (60%) purchase goods or services online, such as travel, holiday, clothes, 
books, tickets, film, music, software, or food; slightly over half (52%) use a social 
networking site; more than four in ten (44%) use websites to share pictures, videos, 
movies, etc.  
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample) 
 
Of the European Internet users, 24% undertake all three activities, 26% two 
activities, 30% one activity and 20% carry out none of these three activities on the 
Internet.  
 
An Internet-use index is developed for this study, based on the number of three types 
of sites used: social networking sites, sharing sites, shopping sites. The internet-use 
index can take the following values: ‘--’ (uses internet but none of those sites), ‘-’ 
(uses one type), ‘+’ (uses two types), ‘++’ (uses all three types). 
 
Of those who shop online, 57% also use social networking sites and 50% use 
websites to share pictures, videos and movies and the like. Two-thirds of social 
networking site users also shop online (66%) or use sharing sites (68%). In turn, the 
majority of respondents who use sharing sites also use social networking sites (81%) 
or shop online (68%).  
 
 
 
                                          
13 QB1a  For each of the following activities, please tell me if it is an activity that you do, or not, on the 
Internet.  
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 81 - 
Socio-demographic characteristics that influence all three types of online activity 
(shopping, social networking, and sharing sites for pictures and the like) are age, 
education, occupation, financial situation, household composition and frequency of 
Internet use.  
? The younger age groups (15-24 and 25-39) are more likely than the older age 
groups (40-55 and 55+) to undertake each of three types of online activity on 
the Internet, with the exception of the youngest respondents aged 15-24 who 
shop online the least. (54%).  
? Internet users with higher education, those who studied until the age 20 or 
later, are the more likely to engage in these activities than users who left 
school at the age of fifteen or younger: online shopping (70% vs. 42%), using 
social networking sites (48% vs. 35%), and using sharing sites (40% vs. 
30%). 
? Turning to occupation, students and unemployed interviewees are far more 
likely to visit social networking sites (85% and 64%) and use sites for sharing 
pictures, movies, etc. (77% and 50%) than the self-employed (44% and 41%) 
and managers (47% and 36%). Managers are the most likely to purchase 
online (75%). 
? Internet users who have difficulties paying their bills most of the time are the 
most likely to visit social networking sites (62%) and sites for sharing pictures, 
movies and the like (50%). Unsurprisingly, purchasing online is most common 
among those who almost never have such financial difficulties (65%).  
? Interviewees who use the Internet every day undertake each of the three 
online activities more often than average: online purchasing (69%), social 
networking sites (60%), and sharing sites for pictures and the like (51%). 
 
Further, two socio demographic characteristics which do not affect all three types of 
online activities but which are still influential are gender and household composition. 
? Women are slightly more likely than men (54% versus 50%) to visit social 
networking or sharing sites; men are more likely to shop online than women 
(62% versus 57%). 
? Respondents living in larger households (3 or 4 and more persons) are more 
likely to use sharing sites (48% each) and social networking sites (57% and 
58% respectively) than two-person households (36% use sharing sites and 
43% use social networking or sharing sites).

1.5.2.1 Shopping online  
 
– Internet users from the north and the west of the European Union are more 
likely to shop online– 
 
A large majority of European Internet users purchase goods or services online (60%). 
The highest percentages of respondents who shop online are found in the northern 
and western Member States: Denmark, the Netherlands (81% each), the United 
Kingdom (79%), Sweden (78%), Ireland (73%), Germany (72%), Finland (69%) and 
France (66%). In contrast, respondents in Bulgaria (21%), Portugal (22%), Greece 
(25%) and Romania (26%) are least likely to purchase on the Internet. There is a 
clear geographical division here between Internet users located in northern and 
western parts of the European and those in the south and east.

1.5.2.2 Social networking sites 
 
– A high rate of social network use in eastern Member States – 
 
Social networking sites are used most often in Hungary (80%), Latvia (73%), Malta 
(71%), Ireland (68%), Cyprus, Slovakia (both 66%), Poland and Denmark (both 
63%), and least in Germany (37%).  
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of total sample) 
 
When comparing this social networking site users map with the online shoppers map 
in the previous section, a general pattern – with few exceptions - emerges: countries 
with high percentages of social networking site users tend to have low percentages of 
online shoppers. Vice-versa, the countries with low percentages of social networking 
site users tend to have high percentages of online shoppers. 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

1.5.2.3 Sites for sharing pictures, videos, movies  
 
– Websites for sharing files are particularly popular in eastern and southern 
Member States – 
 
A majority of Internet users in mostly eastern and southern EU Member States use 
websites to share pictures, videos and movies: Bulgaria, Lithuania (both 59%), 
Cyprus, Slovakia and Ireland (both 58%), Romania, Latvia (both 56%), Greece, 
Hungary and Spain (all 53%), as compared to around one-third of those in Germany 
(32%) and Finland (35%).

1.5.3 Specific activities on the Internet 
 
– European Internet users are more engaged in social activities or transactions on 
the Internet than in complex activities related to software – 
 
The previous section dealt with the European interviewees’ broad interests when they 
use the Internet. This section goes a step further by listing some specific activities. 
Respondents were asked which of the following specific activities they carried out on 
the Internet14.  
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of total sample) 
 
The three most frequent activities, each mentioned by more than four out of ten 
respondents, are home banking (47%), purchasing goods or services from a seller 
located in respondents’ country of residence (46%), and instant messaging, chat 
websites (42%). Those activities are related to either social activities or transactions. 
Conversely, fewer Internet users are engaged into activities specific to the use of 
software such as use of online software (24%) or use peer-to-peer software (15%). 
                                          
14 QB1b Which of the following activities do you also do on the Internet?  
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 88 - 
A country-by-country analysis reveals that home banking is indeed the most 
frequent activity within 13 Member States: Finland (89%), Denmark (86%), the 
Netherlands (84%), Sweden (80%), Latvia, Estonia (both 69%), Belgium (64%), 
Luxembourg (61%), Austria (59%), France, Malta (both 58%), Lithuania (56%) and 
Poland (48%). It is interesting to note that Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands and 
Sweden are also numerous to purchase goods or services online. 
 
Home banking is least widespread in Bulgaria (6%), Greece (10%), Romania, 
Hungary (both 12%) and Portugal (18%).  
As for shopping online, home banking seems to be more developed in the north and 
the west of the European Union than in the south and in the east.  
 
Purchasing goods or services from a seller located within respondents’ country of 
residence is the most frequent activity within four Member States: the United 
Kingdom (64%), Germany (61%), the Czech Republic (56%), and Ireland (50%). 
Online shopping is equally or even more frequent in some other countries: Denmark 
(73%), the Netherlands (68%), Sweden (61%), France (56%), and Finland (52%).    
 
The third most frequent online activity among European Internet users, instant 
messaging and chatting on websites, is most widespread in ten Member States: 
Bulgaria (73%), Spain (69%), Hungary (65%), Slovakia, Cyprus (both 58%), Greece 
(54%), Portugal (50%), Romania (49%), Slovenia (47%) and Italy (45%). It is worth 
adding that those countries tend to show relatively low use of the Internet and low 
use of online shopping.

Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample)

Socio-demographic breakdown shows that age, education, occupation, and 
frequency of Internet use are relevant for all three leading activities, i.e. home 
banking, buying goods or services from a seller within respondents’ country of 
residence, and instant messaging or chatting.  
 
? A clear split is visible between the younger and the older age groups. 
Respondents aged 15-24 and those aged 25-39 (65% and 49% respectively) 
are far more likely to engage in instant messaging and chatting on websites 
than respondents aged 40-54 and 55+ (31% and 22% respectively). However, 
the younger age groups are diametrically opposed when it comes to financial 
activities, with the youngest group aged 15-24 recording the lowest 
percentages and the 25-39 age group the highest for home banking (31% 
versus 54%) and purchasing from a seller inside the country of residence 
(38% versus 50%).  
? Interviewees who were educated until the age of 20 or beyond are most likely 
to use home banking (61%) and to purchase from a seller within their country 
(56%), compared with respondents who finished education at the age of 15 or 
younger (33% and 31% respectively).  
? Managers (62%) and the self-employed (55%) most often use home banking. 
Managers (61%) are also most likely to purchase from a seller in the country 
of residence. Students (69%) and unemployed respondents (53%) have the 
highest percentages for instant messaging or chatting, but the lowest 
percentages for home banking (30% and 36% respectively) and purchasing 
from a seller in the country of residence (each 37%). 
? Respondents who use the Internet every day are far more likely to engage in 
all three activities than those who use the Internet on a less frequent basis 
(“often/sometimes”). This is true for home banking (54% versus 27%), 
purchasing from a seller in the country of residence (53% versus 26%), and 
instant messaging or chatting (47% versus 28%).

1.6 SUMMARY 
 
The major aim of this chapter was to gain insight into respondents’ disclosure of 
personal information: their actual disclosure on the Internet and their opinions about 
their behaviour being recording and about profiling on the Internet. 
 
Around three-quarters of Europeans regard the following information as 
personal: financial information, such as salary, bank details, credit record; medical 
information such as patient record, health information; and their national identity 
number, card number or passport number. Majorities say that their fingerprints, their 
home address, and their mobile phone number are all personal information.  
 
Less than half of Europeans consider photos of themselves (48%), and their name 
(46%) to be personal. Close to a third describe their work history and who their 
friends are as personal information. Around a quarter see the following as personal: 
their tastes and opinions, their nationality; things they do, such as hobbies, sports, 
places they go; and the websites they visit. 
 
Europeans’ perception of the necessity of disclosing personal information is as 
follows. Around three-quarters see disclosing personal information as an increasing 
part of modern life. More than six out of ten agree with the statement that the 
Government of their country of residence asks them for more and more personal 
information; six out of ten think that nowadays one needs to log into several systems 
using several usernames and passwords; and 58% say that there is no alternative to 
disclosing personal information in order to obtain products or services.  
 
Interestingly, three out of ten Europeans agree that disclosing personal information is 
not a big issue for them; that they do not mind disclosing personal information in 
return for free services online, such as a free email address; or that they feel obliged 
to disclose personal information on the Internet.  
 
Turning to the type of personal information disclosed on the Internet, of every 
ten European users of social networking sites or file-sharing sites, around eight give 
their names; over five show photos of themselves; almost five disclose their 
nationality; almost four reveal the things they do (such as hobbies, sports, places 
they go), their home address, and who their friends are. One-third share their tastes 
and opinions.  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 93 - 
Of every ten European online shoppers, almost nine give their name and their home 
address. Less than half of online shoppers give their mobile phone number and 
around one-third reveal their nationality and financial information such as salary, 
bank details and credit record.  
 
The most important reason for disclosure is the same on social networking or file-
sharing sites and on shopping sites, namely to access the service. The next most 
important reasons in social networking are to connect with others and for fun, 
whereas in shopping, next most important reasons are to obtain a service adapted to 
one’s needs and to save time at the next visit.  
 
As to the incidence of over-disclosure, more than four in ten Europeans are always 
or sometimes required to provide more personal information than necessary in order 
to obtain access to or to use an online service.  
 
Seven in ten of the respondents who have experienced it feel concern about over-
disclosure, whereas just over a quarter are ‘not very’ or ‘not at all’ concerned. In all 
but two Member States, concerned respondents clearly outnumber those who are 
unconcerned, the exceptions being Sweden and the Netherlands.  
 
The ranking of the risks associated with disclosure is generally the same for 
social networking or file-sharing sites as for shopping online, with the exception of 
being the victim of fraud: this item is the second most important risk associated with 
social networking but the most important risk in the case of shopping online (41% 
versus 55%). Around four in ten in both groups mention the risk that their 
information will be used without their knowledge, and that their information will be 
shared with third parties without their agreement. 
 
Around half of Europeans are concerned about their behaviour being recorded 
via payment cards (location and spending) or via mobile phone or mobile Internet (by 
call content and geolocation). Around four in ten worry about their behaviour being 
recorded in a private space (such as a restaurant, bar, club, or office), being tracked 
via store or loyalty cards (preferences and consumption, or patterns), or on the 
Internet (browsing, downloading files, accessing content online). More than one-third 
are concerned about their behaviour being recorded in a public space (such as a 
street, subway, or airport). In general, respondents are ‘fairly’ rather than ‘very’ 
concerned. 
 
Over half of the Europeans interviewed feel uncomfortable with profiling on the 
Internet, whereas around four in ten feel comfortable with it. In all but seven of the 
EU Member States, namely Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Finland and the 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 94 - 
United Kingdom, more respondents feel uncomfortable with Internet profiling than 
feel comfortable. 
 
Of every ten Europeans, more than six use the Internet at home; around three at 
work; and more than two do so somewhere else, for example in schools universities, 
cyber-cafés and the like. The largest numbers of Internet users are found in the 
northern EU Member States - the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. 
Smaller numbers are found in the southern and central European countries, in 
particular Portugal, Greece, Hungary and Romania.  
 
Of every ten European Internet users, six visit shopping sites to purchase goods or 
services online, such as travel, holiday, clothes, books, tickets, film, music, software, 
or food; slightly over half use a social networking site; and more than four use 
websites to share pictures, videos, movies, and the like. Shopping online is most 
common in northern and western countries, and least common in the southern and 
central EU Member States, notably those mentioned above. These countries instead 
have the highest rates of sharing site use.  
 
The most frequent online activities, undertaken by more than four out of ten 
respondents, are home banking, purchasing goods or services from a seller located in 
respondents’ country of residence, and instant messaging or chatting on websites. 
Further, around a quarter of the interviewees make or receive phone calls or video 
calls over the Internet using online software, and submit tax declarations or use other 
online government services.

2 AWARENESS AND PERCEIVED CONTROL 
 
The previous chapter described Europeans’ attitudes towards disclosing personal 
information and what type of personal information they actually disclose on the 
Internet.  
 
Identity management systems are information systems or technologies that can be 
used to support the management of identities: for example establishing an identity by 
linking a name or number to a person, or follow identity activity by recording and/or 
providing access to logs of identity activity. These systems are now largely used on 
the Internet, and they increase the need to protect the user’s identity.  
 
This chapter addresses the question how knowledgeable Europeans are regarding 
protecting their identity and personal information, taking into account the 
development of Identity management systems. First respondents’ own identity 
management in daily life and on the Internet will be examined. The following section 
discusses respondents’ experiences regarding personal data: privacy statements, 
informed consent and their satisfaction about them. Next, the control that the 
interviewees feel they have over their personal data will be presented. The chapter 
ends by presenting respondents’ awareness of the possibility of and experiences with 
identity theft and data loss.  
 
2.1 Identity management 
 
Before discussing how the Europeans surveyed protect their identity in daily life and 
on the Internet, this section presents the types of credentials they use, i.e. the types 
of identity papers and identity cards they usually use. 
 
2.1.1 Type of personal credentials used  
 
- Around two-thirds of Europeans use credit cards and bank cards; more than 
half of the 15-24 group use an Internet account – 
 
Respondents were asked which type of personal credentials they use15. Almost three-
quarters of respondents use credit cards and bank cards (74%). Around two-thirds 
use national identity cards or residence permits (68%), government entitlement cards 
(65%), or driving licences (63%). Almost half of the interviewees use customer cards, 
such as loyalty cards and frequent flyer cards (47%), or a passport (43%). One-third 
                                          
15 QB14 Which of the following do you currently use?  
 
 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 96 - 
have an account they use on the Internet, such as email, or for social networking or 
commercial services (34%). Students also use student cards (5%). 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
A country-by-country analysis shows that credit cards and bank cards are used by 
vast majorities in Sweden (97%), the Netherlands (96%), Denmark (94%), and 
Finland (93%), but by fewer than half of respondents in Romania (43%), Greece 
(44%) and Poland (49%). In general, respondents from the north and the west of the 
European Union are more likely to use credit cards and bank cards than those in 
eastern Member States. 
 
The use of national identity cards or residence permits varies greatly across countries. 
They are the most frequently used of all eight types of personal credentials in thirteen  
Member States, led by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Spain, Hungary (all 95%), Malta 
(93%) and Poland (92%). In contrast, they are scarcely used in Latvia (1%), 
Denmark (3%), the United Kingdom and Ireland (both 9%). Here, respondents 
located in countries located in the east of the European Union are more likely to use 
national identity cards than those living in the north and west. Interestingly, there are 
no such differences in the use of passports. 
 
Similarly, the use of government entitlement cards differs markedly across countries. 
They are widely used in Denmark, Slovenia (both 96%), the Czech Republic (94%), 
Hungary, Slovakia, Finland (each 93%), Belgium, Germany (92%) and Austria (91%), 
but rarely in Bulgaria (3%) and Romania (7%).  
Driving licenses are used most often as personal credentials in Denmark (81%), the 
Netherlands (80%), and Finland and Sweden (both 79%), and least often in Romania 
(28%).

A socio-demographic analysis yields some differences between groups in terms of 
gender, age, household composition, education, occupation, financial situation, social 
position, and internet activity. This is true particularly for driving licenses, customer 
cards, passports and Internet accounts. 
 
Men are more likely than women to use these items – with the exception of customer 
cards and government entitlement cards. Respondents aged 15-24 are the most likely 
to have an Internet account (52%), but less likely to have any of the other items. 
Self-employed people, managers, other white collar workers and manual workers are 
the occupational groups most likely to have these items, with one exception: 54% of 
students have an Internet account. Furthermore, interviewees who have difficulties 
with paying their bills most of the time and respondents who place themselves low on 
the social scale are less likely to have these items – the latter group more often have 
national identity cards instead. Finally, respondents with a high Internet-use index 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

(++) are more likely to have these items, but less likely to use national identity 
cards.  
 
Online shoppers and social networking and sharing site users are logically far more 
likely to use an account on the Internet than others. For instance, 62% of online 
shoppers use such an account, compared with only 38% of those who do not shop 
online.

2.1.2 Identity protection in daily life 
 
- More than six Europeans out of ten give the minimum required information to 
protect their identity - 
 
To protect their identity in daily life16, a majority of Europeans give the minimum 
required information (62%) or do not disclose their bank details or PIN numbers 
(56%), while almost half disclose information only to people and organisations they 
trust (47%) or do not disclose their user names and passwords (45%). 
 
Around three out of ten respondents use cash instead of recorded transactions such 
as bank cards and transfers (30%), shred old bills, bank statements, credit card 
receipts and so on (29%), do not disclose payment card details online (29%), and 
adjust the information they disclose to different contexts, for example depending on 
whether they are dealing with a company, a bank or a website (27%). Finally, only a 
few interviewees provide wrong information to protect their identity in daily life (7%).

following list.  
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 101 - 
A closer look at the ranking of strategies used by Europeans to protect their identity 
in daily life reveals that rather passive strategies, such as withholding personal 
information, occur more frequently than active strategies, such as deliberately 
providing wrong information or first evaluating the context and then adjusting the 
type of personal information disclosed. 
 
A country by country breakdown shows that giving the minimum required 
information and not disclosing bank details or PIN number are the most common 
strategies in fourteen Member States; these two strategies stand in joint first place in 
two other countries, Denmark (78%) and in the UK (66%).  
 
Over three-quarters of respondents in Finland (78%), Luxembourg (76%), and 
Germany and the Netherlands (each 74%) give the minimum required information, 
whereas half or under do so in Poland (45%), Lithuania and Italy (both 50%).  
 
Large majorities in Sweden (85%) and the Netherlands (84%) do not disclose their 
bank details or PIN numbers, compared to around a third or less in Italy (27%), 
Poland (34%) and Romania (35%). 
 
Two-thirds or more of respondents in the Netherlands (72%), Denmark (68%) and 
Malta (66%) disclose information only to people and organisations they trust, 
compared to around one-third in Poland (34%), Romania (32%) and Portugal (28%).  
 
Not disclosing user names and passwords varies greatly across countries: around 
three-quarters of respondents in Sweden (78%), Finland (77%) and the Netherlands 
(73%) adopt this strategy compared to only 14% in Italy and 16% in Bulgaria. 
 
Respondents use cash instead of recorded transactions (such as bank cards and 
transfers) as a strategy to protect their identity most often in Poland (44%), Austria 
(40%), Hungary (39%) and Latvia (38%) and least often in the Netherlands (15%), 
Finland (17%), France and Denmark (both 18%). Interestingly, this strategy reverses 
the order of countries found in respect of all other strategies.  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 102 - 
The UK stands out with six out of ten (59%) respondents shredding old bills, bank 
statements, credit card receipts and the like, compared to only one out of ten in 
Portugal (8%) and Romania and Italy (both 10%). Respondents in Estonia (59%) are 
the most likely not to disclose payment card details online compared to only 4% in 
Bulgaria and 10% in Portugal. In Sweden, a majority of 58% of respondents adjust 
the information they disclose to different contexts (depending on whether they are 
dealing with a company, a bank or a website) compared to only 6% in Romania and 
10% in Lithuania. Finally, providing wrong information as a strategy to protect 
identity occurs rarely and varies from 11% in Austria to 2% in Denmark and Malta.  
 
In conclusion, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and 
Finland top the list of the countries with highest percentages of respondent adopting 
various strategies to protect their identity in daily life. It is interesting to note that 
these countries were also generally less concerned about their behaviour being 
recorded, as we saw earlier. This may be explained by the fact that they are more 
aware of the strategies for protecting their identities. 
 
These strategies are least likely to be used in the southern European countries 
Portugal and Italy, the Baltic countries Lithuania and Latvia, and the eastern and 
central countries Poland, Hungary and Romania.

A socio-demographic breakdown reveals great disparities between groups in 
respect of all the strategies to protect identity in daily life. Age, education and 
occupation all make a difference. Gender is of less importance here. 
 
Respondents aged 15-24 are least likely to shred old bills, bank statements, credit 
card receipts, etc. (17%); the oldest respondents (aged 55+) are the least likely to 
avoid disclosing their user names and passwords (34%). With respect to all but two 
strategies, the longer respondents have spent in education, the more likely they are 
to use a strategy; the two exceptions being the use of cash instead of recorded 
transactions and shredding old bills and the like.  
 
Turning to occupation, managers and other white collar workers are more likely to 
use each of these strategies (apart from the use of cash instead of recorded 
transactions), whereas students tend to use most of the strategies less with the 
exception of not disclosing their user names and passwords (53%) and providing 
wrong information (11%).  
 
The level of Internet use has an impact on the results for this question. For instance, 
66% of online shoppers do not disclose their user names and passwords compared 
with 50% of those who do not shop online. Again, 70% of online shoppers do not 
disclose their bank details or PIN numbers, compared with only 55% of other Internet 
users.

2.1.3 Identity protection on the Internet 
 
- More than 4 out of 10 Internet users use tools and strategies to limit unwanted 
emails - 
 
This section focuses on the identity protection of respondents who use the Internet17.  
 
Approximately four out of ten European Internet users apply tools and strategies to 
limit unwanted emails (spam) (42%), check that a transaction is protected or that the 
site has a safety logo or label (40%), or use anti-spy software (39%). One-third of 
respondents delete cookies (35%).  
 
Around one-fifth of the Internet users change the security settings of their browser to 
increase privacy (22%), or avoid providing the same information to different sites 
(21%). Smaller numbers use a search engine to maintain awareness of the 
information circulating about them on the Internet (14%), or a dummy email account 
(12%), and only a few ask websites to access the information they hold about them 
in order to update it or delete it (8%). 
 
Finally, it is interesting to note that a sizeable minority of 15% spontaneously say that 
they do nothing to protect their identity on the Internet.

Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 107 - 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample) 
 
The reader may note that the top five methods of protecting identity on the Internet 
are rather technical or procedural, whereas the less frequent approaches involve 
some kind of individual initiative on behalf of the internet user, such as maintaining 
awareness through search engines, creating dummy email accounts and requesting 
websites to provide access to the information they hold.  
 
A country by country analysis reveals that using tools to limit unwanted emails 
(spam) is the most frequent strategy in thirteen EU Member States, the use of anti-
spy software in seven, checking whether the transaction is protected or the site has a 
safety logo/label in four, and avoiding providing the same information to different 
sites in only three Member States.  
 
Denmark (72%) stands out with the highest percentage of Internet users applying 
tools and strategies to limit unwanted emails (spam), followed by Luxembourg 
(64%), Sweden (63%) and the Netherlands (62%) and compared to fewer than one 
in five Internet users in Latvia and in Portugal (both 19%).  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 108 - 
Checking that the transaction is protected or the site has a safety logo/label is cited 
by more than half of respondents in the Netherlands (57%), France (56%), and 
Luxembourg (54%) compared to fewer than one in five in Romania and Bulgaria (both 
13%), and Lithuania (17%).  
 
The use of anti-spy software varies widely across countries: around one-third of 
Internet users in the Netherlands (67%), Denmark (66%), and the UK (63%) 
compared to only 5% in Bulgaria, 12% in Latvia, and 17% in both Lithuania and Italy.  
 
Half of the respondents who use the Internet in the Netherlands and Luxembourg 
(both 53%) delete cookies, compared with only 10% in Romania, 12% in Bulgaria 
and 17% in Hungary. 
 
Three out of ten Internet users change the security settings of their browser to 
increase privacy in Luxembourg (31%), Germany (30%), and the Netherlands (29%) 
compared with 9% in Romania and 12% in both Lithuania and Bulgaria. 
 
Slovakia (46%) stands out with the highest percentage of respondents who avoid 
providing the same information to different sites, followed at some distance by the 
Czech Republic (30%); the lowest percentages were found in Denmark (12%) and 
France (15%).   
 
Using a search engine to maintain awareness of what information circulates about 
them on the Internet was most often reported by Internet users in Estonia (24%) and 
least often in Romania (8%); the use of a dummy email account most frequently in 
Austria (25%) and least in Malta, Denmark, and the Czech Republic (all 6%); asking 
websites to access the information these sites hold about them in order to update it 
or delete it most frequently in Cyprus (15%) and least often in Slovenia, Romania, 
and Poland (all 4%).  
 
In short, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Denmark stand out as Member States 
with the largest numbers of Internet users who use a variety of strategies to protect 
their identity on the Internet. This habit is least common in the Baltic countries 
Lithuania and Latvia, and the eastern EU Member States Romania and Bulgaria.

A socio-demographic analysis shows that education and occupation make a 
difference when it comes to identity protection on the Internet, while gender and age 
yield fewer and smaller differences. Nonetheless, a general pattern emerges in which 
the more technical or procedural (top five) strategies are more likely among men than 
women, among older respondents than the youngest (aged 15-24), among 
respondents who spent longer in education than the less educated interviewees, and 
among managers than those without paid work.  
 
Still, compared with the socio-demographic variables, the Internet-use index reveals 
the largest differences between groups that active Internet users (++) are more likely 
than less active users (--) to apply each of the strategies with the exception of 
avoiding providing the same information to different sites.  
More than half of online shoppers check that the transaction is protected or that the 
site has a safety logo/ label (52%), use tools and strategies to limit unwanted emails

third parties 
 
2.2.1 Reading privacy statements on Internet 
 
- A majority of Internet users usually read privacy statements on the 
Internet, but a quarter read them without fully understanding them - 
 
Respondents who use the Internet were asked whether they usually read privacy 
statements on the Internet18. Close to six in ten respondents say they do (58%): a 
third say that they read them and understand them (34%), a quarter that they read 
them but do not fully understand them (24%). A quarter say they do not read them 
(25%), almost one in ten ignore privacy statements (8%), and one in twenty say they 
do not know where to find them (5%).  
But it might be considered that this percentage of 58% Internet users who say that 
they read the privacy statements on the Internet is a relatively high proportion. But it 
might also be thought that the fact that 24% say that they read them without fully 
understanding them and that 38% of Internet users say that they do not read 
these privacy statements at all somewhat undermines this result.

A country by country analysis reveals major differences from one country to another: 
seven in ten respondents or more in Hungary (76%), Portugal (73%), Cyprus (72%) 
and Greece (70%) usually read the privacy statements on the Internet. There are few 
or no differences between the proportions who read those privacy statements and 
understand them and those who read them but do not fully understand them in

France (24% usually read and understand them while 24% usually read them but do 
not fully understand them), Finland (27% vs. 26%), Luxembourg (25% vs. 23%) and 
Denmark (24% vs. 21%).  
Respondents who say they usually do not read the privacy statements are found most 
frequently in the Netherlands (39%), Spain (37%), and Denmark (34%).  
 
Interviewees who ignore privacy statements on the Internet are found most often in 
Lithuania (14%) and Luxembourg (13%), while those who do not know where to find 
the privacy statements are mostly found in Estonia (10%), Lithuania (9%) and 
Finland (8%).

Socio-demographic analysis shows that self-employed respondents (62%) and 
managers (64%) read privacy statements most often. There are few differences by 
level of education in terms of behaviour: 55% of those who left school before 16 read 
them, compared with 59% of those who studied until the age of 20 or later. However, 
the latter are more likely to understand these privacy statements than the first group 
(38% vs. 29%). Percentages of interviewees who say they usually do not read 
privacy statements are highest amongst the youngest respondents aged 15-24 
(31%), and students.

2.2.2 Adapting behaviour after reading privacy statements on the Internet 
 
- Seven in ten respondents who read privacy statements on the Internet 
have adapted their behaviour - 
 
It is interesting to see whether reading privacy statements influences actual 
behaviour on the Internet. Those respondents who said they usually do read privacy 
statements were asked if they had subsequently adapted their Internet behaviour; 
more specifically, whether they had decided at least once not to use an online service, 
or had been more cautious about the personal information they disclose on the 
Internet19.  
 
Over two-third of the respondents who usually read privacy statements did adapt 
their behaviour on the Internet (70%): half of them had become more cautious about 
the personal information they disclose on the Internet (35%) and the other half took 
a step further and had decided, at least once, not to use an online service. Three in 
ten of the respondents who usually read privacy statements had not adapted their 
Internet behaviour (29%).

In each of the Member States - with the exception of the UK - a majority of the 
interviewees had adapted their behaviour after reading privacy statements on the 
Internet: they had decided at least once not to use an online service, or they had 
become more cautious about the personal information they disclosed on the Internet. 
This is particularly true in Malta (91%), Cyprus (90%), Austria, Slovenia (both 87%), 
Romania (86%) and Ireland (85%). The lowest percentage is found in the UK (47%), 
which is also the only country where a majority say they have not adapted their 
behaviour (52%). 
Respondents in Austria (47%), Germany and France (44% in both cases), and 
Luxembourg (43%) are most likely to have modified their behaviour by deciding at 
least once not to use an online service.

A socio-demographic breakdown does not yield significant differences, with the 
exception of white collar workers who are most likely to say they did adapt their 
behaviour (74%). Managers are remarkable in the sense that 40% of them say that 
they have already at least once decided not to use an online service. Those who are 
concerned about their behaviour being recorded on the Internet are more likely to 
have adapted their behaviour after reading privacy statements than those who are 
not concerned (64%).

2.2.3 Reasons for not reading privacy statements on the Internet 
 
- Knowing that these websites have a privacy policy is sufficient for 41% 
of those who do not read or ignore privacy statements - 
 
Those respondents who usually do not read privacy statements on the Internet were 
asked about their reasons for not doing so20; four in ten think it is sufficient for them 
to see that websites have a privacy policy (41%); around a quarter believe the law 
will protect them in any case (27%), or conversely, that the websites will not honour 
the privacy statements anyway (24%).  
 
 
Base: Respondents who do not read privacy statements (21% of the whole sample) 
 
Turning to the results per country regarding respondents’ reasons for not reading 
privacy statements, the following countries have majorities replying that it is 
sufficient for them to see that websites have a privacy policy: Finland (66%), 
Slovenia (56%), Sweden (55%), the Netherlands (54%) and Slovakia (51%). This 
was also the most frequent response in 18 of the 27 EU Member States.  
 
Member States with the highest proportion of respondents saying they believe the law 
would protect them in any case are Austria (45%), Hungary and Portugal (37% in 
each country) and Poland (35%). This was the most frequent response in these four 
countries.  
 
Countries where respondents most frequently answered that they think the websites 
will not honour the privacy statements anyway are Greece (49%), Bulgaria (44%), 
the Czech Republic (40%), Cyprus (36%) and Slovakia (35%). It was also the most 
cited answer in Lithuania (32%).

A socio-demographic breakdown demonstrates that respondents saying it is

found amongst the unemployed (46%). Respondents who left school at the age of 15 
or younger (31%) are most likely to believe they are protected by the law in any 
case.  
 
Retired interviewees (28%) and respondents who have difficulties with paying their 
bills most of the time (32%) seem to have some reservations about the 
trustworthiness of Internet websites, as they more often think the websites will not 
honour privacy statements anyway as compared to the youngest respondents aged 
15-24 (20%) and students (20%), who are the least inclined to think so.

2.2.4 Incidence of informed consent when joining a social network site or 
registering for a service online 
 
- Over half of Internet users are informed about the data collection 
conditions and the further uses of their data when joining a social 
networking site or registering for a service online - 
 
People intending to join a social networking site or register for a service online are 
usually asked to disclose personal information. All respondents who use the Internet 
were asked if they had been informed, on such occasions, about the conditions for the 
collection of data and the further uses of their data under these circumstances.  
 
A majority of the European Internet users surveyed say they were always or 
sometimes informed about the conditions and further uses (54%, 62%)21, whereas 
close to three in ten say they were rarely or never informed (28%, 32%).

2.2.5 Satisfaction with information provided by social network sites about 
the possible consequences of disclosing personal information  
 
- Almost half of social network and/or sharing sites users feel sufficiently 
informed, but almost half do not - 
 
Those respondents who use social networking or sharing sites were then asked 
whether these sites sufficiently inform their users about the possible consequences of 
disclosing personal information22: social network users and online shoppers hold 
similar views on this issue. Almost half of the respondents say they are sufficiently 
informed (49%). However, an almost equal proportion says that they are not (46%).

The countries with the largest proportions of sufficiently-informed respondents are 
Portugal (73%), Hungary (67%), Italy (65%), Malta (64%) and Ireland (60%). 
Conversely, the lowest proportions are recorded in Luxembourg (32%), France 
(35%), the Netherlands, and Germany (both 37%). A national pattern seems to 
emerge here, with countries like Portugal, Hungary and Ireland having a high 
proportion of respondents who feel sufficiently informed (whether about the 
conditions and further uses of the personal information they are asked to disclose, or 
the possible consequences of disclosing personal information) whereas this feeling is 
much less widespread in Luxembourg, France or Germany.

sites sufficiently inform their users about the possible consequences of disclosing 
personal information. On the other hand fewer older people (37% of the 55+ group, 
37% of the retired) and managers (38%) think that this information is sufficient. Here 
again, trusting Internet companies or telecoms providers to protect personal 
information suggests that respondents feel well-informed by the social networking or 
sharing sites: those who trust Internet companies (63%) and telecoms providers 
(61%) feel well informed (vs. 42% and 41% respectively of those who distrust these 
companies).

2.3.1 Perceived control over information disclosed on social network sites 
 
- Eight in ten social network users who disclosed personal information  
feel in control - 
 
Respondents who had disclosed personal information on social networking or sharing 
sites were asked how much control they felt they had over the information they had 
disclosed, such as the ability to amend, delete or correct this information23.  
 
A large majority feel they have some control (78%), whereas one-fifth of the 
respondents do not feel in control at all (20%). Of the interviewees who feel in 
control, two-thirds feel they have only partial control and one-third feel they have 
complete control (52% and 26% respectively of all respondents who had disclosed 
personal information).

Furthermore, the largest proportions of respondents feeling in complete control are 
recorded in Cyprus (52%) and Malta (45%). In these two countries, it is the majority 
view. Portugal has the largest proportion of respondents feeling partially in control 
(64%), followed by Austria (62%), Finland (61%), and Poland (60%).

Socio-demographic analysis shows that feelings of complete control over personal

those aged 15-24, students, and house persons (all groups 31%). No control at all 
was mentioned most frequently by respondents who had left school at the age of 15

who have difficulties paying their bills most of the time (27%).  
 
2.3.2. Perceived control over information disclosed when shopping online 
 
- Seven in ten online shoppers who  
disclosed personal information feel in control - 
 
Turning now to the interviewees who had disclosed personal information when 
shopping online, they were also asked how much control they felt they had over the 
personal information they disclosed24.  
Of the respondents who had disclosed personal information when shopping online, a 
majority (though smaller than with social networking) feel in control (68%): a similar 
proportion as in social networking feel partially in control (50%), while fewer feel in 
complete control (18%). Three in ten feel not in control at all (30%), which is more 
than in social networking.  
Interestingly, online shoppers feel in control less often and less strongly than social 
network users.

These countries also have largest proportions of interviewees feeling that they have

Portugal (66%), Ireland (60%), and again Hungary (59%). Respondents who feel no 
control at all are most common in Germany (41%) and France (38%).  
Interestingly, these countries with highest percentages of respondents feeling in 
control are also the countries with the largest percentages of sufficiently-informed 
respondents – as was discussed in a preceding section in this chapter. The converse is

2.4 Identity theft and data loss 
 
- Awareness of issues in relation to data losses and identity theft is 
widespread; personal experience remains marginal - 
 
All Europeans surveyed were asked whether they had heard of or experienced issues 
related to data losses and identity theft in the last 12 months25.  
 
Over four in ten interviewees answer no (44%) to this question. Over four in ten 
respondents also say they have heard about this issue through television, radio, 
newspapers, and the Internet (42%), and far fewer respondents say through word of 
mouth (13%).  
 
Few respondents had experienced issues related to data losses and identity theft 
affecting their acquaintances (7%), a member of their family (3%), or themselves 
directly (2%).

Finland (31%), and the UK (34%). 
 
In every single EU Member State, hearing through television, radio, newspapers and 
the Internet was by far most frequently mentioned, with the largest majorities in 
Latvia (69%), Sweden (62%), Denmark (61%) and Finland (59%). Hearing through

2.5 Summary 
 
This chapter has addressed the question of how knowledgeable Europeans are 
regarding how to protect their identity and personal information.  
 
Europeans use various types of credentials; three-quarters use credit cards and 
bank cards; around two-thirds use national identity cards or residence permits, 
government entitlement cards, or driving licences. Almost half use customer cards, 
such as loyalty cards and frequent flyer cards, and more than four out of ten use a 
passport. One-third of the respondents have an account they use on the Internet, 
such as email, or for social networking or commercial services. One in twenty use a 
student card. 
 
To protect their identity in daily life, around six out of ten Europeans give the 
minimum required information or do not disclose their bank details or PIN numbers, 
while almost half disclose information only to people and organisations they trust, or 
do not disclose their user names and passwords. Around three out of ten respondents 
use cash instead of recorded transactions such as bank cards and transfers; they 
shred old bills, bank statements, credit card receipts, etc.; they do not disclose 
payment card details online; and they adjust the information they disclose to different 
contexts, for example depending on whether they are dealing with a company, a bank 
or a website. Less than one in ten Europeans provide false information.  
 
To protect their identity on the Internet, around four in ten European Internet 
users apply tools and strategies to limit unwanted emails and spam, check that a 
transaction is protected or that the site has a safety logo or label, or use anti-spy 
software. Around one in three respondents delete cookies. Slightly more than one-
fifth of the Internet users change the security settings of their browser to increase 
privacy, or avoid providing the same information to different sites. Other “protection 
techniques” are cited by 15% Europeans or less.  
 
With regard to respondents’ awareness of the possible accessibility of their personal 
data to third parties, almost six in ten Internet users usually read privacy 
statements, and the majority of those who read them adapt their behaviour on 
the Internet: it seems that informing Europeans about personal data can help to 
raise awareness and to persuade them to be more cautious when disclosing personal 
information. 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 136 - 
When interviewees who do not usually read them are asked their reasons for not 
reading privacy statements, four in ten say that it is enough to see that websites 
have a privacy statement, while around a quarter believe the law will protect them in 
any case, or that the websites will not honour the privacy statements anyway.  
 
Over half of European internet users say they are ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’ informed 
about the conditions for the data collection and the further uses of their data when 
they join a social networking site or register for a service online; Still, almost three in 
ten say they were rarely or never informed.  
 
Almost half of the social networking or sharing sites users say that these sites 
sufficiently inform them about the possible consequences of disclosing; However, an 
only slighter proportion say that is not the case.  
 
A majority of Europeans who have disclosed personal information on social 
networking or sharing sites feel in control of their personal data, e.g. the ability 
to change, delete or correct this information; a quarter feel in complete control, over 
half feel they have partial control, while one-fifth do not feel they have any control at 
all. 
 
A majority of the respondents who have disclosed personal information when 
shopping online feel in control; less than one-fifth feel in complete control, half feel 
partially in control, while three in ten do not feel in control at all. 
 
More than four in ten Europeans have heard about issues related to data losses and 
identity theft in the last 12 months through television, radio, newspapers, and the 
Internet, while only just over one in ten respondents have heard about these issues 
by word of mouth.  
 
Less than one in ten Europeans have experienced issues related to data losses and 
identity theft affecting their acquaintances; only very few have experienced it within 
their families, or personally. 
 
In conclusion, substantial proportions of Europeans appear to be in need of 
information on personal data.

3 PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA 
 
 
The preceding chapters of this report discussed Europeans’ actual disclosure of 
personal information. 
  
This chapter presents respondents’ opinions about ways to protect such personal 
data. Firstly, identity protection in daily life and on the Internet will be addressed, 
followed by a discussion of interviewees’ expectations of organizations holding 
personal data: their trust in such organizations, their concern about the further uses 
of personal data, whether they would like to be able to grant or withhold consent to 
use these data, and whether they would like to be informed about any personal data 
loss.  
 
The chapter ends with respondents’ perceptions about access to their personal data: 
their willingness to pay for access to personal data held, their reasons for deleting 
such data, the importance they attach to portability of personal data across service 
providers, whether and how often they change their privacy settings on social 
networking sites, and, if not, their reasons for not changing these settings. 
 
 
3.1 Expectations of organizations holding personal data 
 
3.1.1 Trust in institutions and companies  
 
- A majority of Europeans trust institutions to protect their information but not 
commercial companies – 
 
Different authorities (government departments, local authorities, agencies) and 
private companies collect and store personal data. Respondents were asked to what 
extent they trust the following institutions to protect their personal information26.

such as the European Commission and the European Parliament (55%).  
 
However, fewer people trust shops and department stores (39%); phone companies, 
mobile phone companies and Internet service providers (32%); and Internet 
companies such as search engines, social networking sites and e-mail services (22%).  
In short, authorities and institutions are trusted more than commercial companies. 
 
As we have seen in chapter 1, a majority of Europeans were concerned about their 
behaviour being recorded via payment cards, their mobile phone or on the Internet. 
That concern might be related to the limited trust in commercial organisations that 
collect these data.

Further cross-analyses regarding feelings of control and informed consent as 
discussed in chapter two reveals that those who distrust the public authorities are 
more likely (29%) to feel no control at all over the personal information they disclose 
on social networking and sharing sites compared to those who do trust the public 
authorities (17%). In addition, considerably fewer of the interviewees who do not 
trust Internet companies and telecoms providers (50% and 49% respectively) had 
been informed about the conditions for the data collection and the further uses of 
their data, compared to those who do have trust in these companies (64% and 62% 
respectively were informed). 
 
A country-by-country analysis shows that health and medical institutions are 
trusted by majorities in every EU Member State, led by Denmark (93%), Belgium 
(91%), Luxembourg and Finland (both 90%). These majorities are smallest in Greece 
(58%), Romania (61%) and Poland (63%).  
 
Majorities in all EU Member States also trust national public authorities such as tax 
authorities and social security authorities. The majorities are largest in Denmark 
(92%), Luxembourg (88%), Finland (87%) and Sweden (86%) and smallest in 
Greece (52%), Poland and Romania (both 61%).  
 
Banks and financial institutions are trusted by majorities in all but two Member 
States. They are trusted most in Denmark (92%), Finland (91%) and Sweden (88%) 
and least in Romania (43%) and Greece (21%). Unsurprisingly, Greece is also the 
only Member State with a majority saying they do not trust these institutions (78%). 
 
The graph below shows that there is a correlation between trust in national public 
authorities and trust in banks and financial institutions. At the top, Nordic countries, 
the Netherlands and Estonia – countries where respondents are least concerned about 
their behaviour being recorded in general - record a large majority of citizens who 
trust both banks and national authorities. The level of trust is lower in Romania, 
Poland and Italy. 
 
Interestingly, the level of trust of institutions therefore seems more related to 
national contexts than to the institutions themselves.

European institutions such as the European Commission and the European Parliament 
are trusted by majorities in all but four Member States. Trust is most widespread in 
Hungary, Slovakia, Luxembourg and Belgium (all 73%) and lowest in the UK (38%) 
and Greece (46%); Greece again being the only Member States where a majority do 
not trust the institutions (52%). In two other countries only small majorities trust the 
European institutions, nevertheless still larger than the proportion of respondents who 
do not trust them: Germany (48% versus 45%) and Cyprus (47% versus 34%).

Trust in shops and department stores is highest in Finland (63%), Estonia (57%), and 
Ireland (56%). These are also the only three Member States where clearly more 
respondents trust them than not (36%, 40% and 39% respectively). Respondents 
trust shops and stores least in Greece (23%) and Bulgaria and Romania (both 28%).  
 
Estonia (65%) stands out with the highest percentages of interviewees who trust 
phone companies, mobile phone companies and Internet service providers, followed 
at some distance by Finland (55%) and Malta (52%). The lowest percentages are 
found in Greece (14%) and Germany (20%).

In every single Member State, more people do not trust than trust Internet 
companies such as search engines, social networking sites and e-mail services. 
Nevertheless, trust levels are highest in Finland (33%), Estonia, Slovakia and 
Denmark (all 32%).   
  
In conclusion, Finland stands out as the country with highest levels of trust in almost 
all institutions or companies involved in the protection of personal information; 
followed firstly by Denmark, Luxembourg and Estonia (the latter only for companies), 
and then by Belgium, Sweden, and Slovakia. In contrast, the country standing out for 
the lowest trust levels is Greece, in all institutions and companies, followed by 
Romania, and, at some distance, by Poland.

QB25. Different authorities (government departments, local authorities, agencies) and private companies collect

information?
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
A socio-demographic breakdown reveals that age, education, financial situation and 
social position make a difference, while occupation and gender are of less relevance. 
A general pattern emerges with the respondents aged 15-24 showing the most trust 
in all institutions and companies, as do students. This is particularly the case for the 
European institutions with 67% of the youngest age group saying that they trust 
them to protect their data, compared with only 53% of the respondents aged 40-54 
and 48% of the oldest group, who also record a high level of “don’t know” answers, 
13%.

In contrast, the opposite is true of respondents who left school at the age of 15 or 
younger, except in the case of health and medical institutions and shops and 
department stores. Furthermore, respondents who have difficulties with paying their 
bills most of the time and interviewees who place themselves low on the social scale 
are least likely to trust all institutions and companies. It is especially interesting to 
note that 70% of respondents who position themselves high on the social scale trust 
the banks and financial institutions compared with only 55% of those who are at the 
bottom. 
 
Finally, the Internet-use index shows that the more active the users the more likely 
they are to trust the bodies holding their information. Trust levels stand at 36% for 
both social networking site users and sharing site users compared to 22% and 24% 
respectively of those who do not use these websites.

3.1.2 Concern about the further uses of personal data than the ones it was 
originally collected for 
 
– Seven Europeans out of ten are concerned about the potential use that 
companies may make of the information disclosed – 
 
Companies holding personal information may sometimes use it for a purpose other 
than that for which it was collected (e.g. for direct marketing or targeted online 
advertising), without informing the individuals concerned. Respondents were asked 
how worried they were about this use of their information.27 A large majority of 
respondents are concerned (70%). Only 27% say they are not. The potential misuse 
of personal information may be one explanation of the general distrust Europeans 
have in commercial companies to protect their data.

3.1.3 Perceptions on individual's consent for the processing of their 
personal data 
 
– Nearly all Europeans would like to give their specific approval before the 
collection and processing of their personal information – 
 
All respondents were asked whether their specific approval should be required before 
any kind of personal information is collected and processed.28 A large majority say 
their approval should be required in all cases (74%). Only around one in ten says yes, 
in the case of personal information collected on the Internet (12%), or yes, in the 
case of sensitive information (health religion, political beliefs or sexual preferences - 
8%).

(all 96%) are most likely to say that their specific approval should be obtained. Large 
majorities also hold this opinion overall in all other Member States, the lowest score 
being 83% in Portugal.   
 
The detailed results show that Sweden (60%), Austria and the Netherlands (both 
61%) and Finland and Belgium (66% each) are the countries where respondents are 
least likely to want to give specific approval before all categories of personal 
information are collected and processed. It should be remembered that Sweden, 
Finland and the Netherlands are countries where the level of trust in data collection 
and use is generally the highest. This could explain why the largest number of 
respondents in these countries would like the opportunity to give specific approval for 
data use in a given context and not all the time.

There are very few significant socio-demographic differences on this question, with 
a huge majority of respondents wishing to be informed in the event that their 
personal information is lost or stolen.  
 
Education is one of the few variables that play a role here. 91% of respondents who 
studied until the age of 20 or beyond want to be informed, compared with 82% of 
those whose education ended before the age of 16. This may be explained by the fact 
that the most educated group are more exposed to data disclosure.  
 
Crossing the Internet-use index with these results also yields interesting results: 93% 
of ‘++’ Internet users want to be informed compared with 83% of ‘- -’ Internet users.

3.2.1 Willingness to pay for access to personal data held by organisations

their personal data - 
 
More than a quarter of respondents (28%) are prepared to pay for access to personal 
information stored by public or private entities, whereas a majority of 66% say they 
are not willing to pay30.  
 
Though a majority Europeans believe that they are responsible for their own data, 
paying to obtain personal information is not an option: it should be a free service.

EUR)”, 12% “yes, up to (20 EUR)” and 3% “Yes, more than (20 EUR)”. This is the 
only country where a majority are prepared to pay to access this information. A fairly 
high proportion is prepared to pay for access in Slovakia (44%), Finland (42%) and 
Austria (40%). 
 
In contrast, the lowest percentages are found in France (18%), in Portugal (12%) and 
in Spain (8%).  
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 156 - 
A socio-demographic analysis reveals that age, education, occupation, financial 
situation and social position are all of relevance. Respondents aged 55+ (23%) are 
least willing to pay, and respondents aged 25-39 (34%) most willing. The longer 
respondents spent in education, the more likely they are to be willing to pay: 37% of 
respondents who were educated until the age of 20 or beyond compared to 17% of 
respondents who left school at the age of 15 or younger. Managers (43%), other 
white collar workers (36%) self-employed respondents (34%) and students (33%) 
are more likely than average to be willing to pay for access to their personal data. 
Furthermore, respondents who have difficulties with paying their bills most of the 
time (22%) and interviewees who place themselves low on the social scale (22%) are 
least likely to pay to access their data. 
 
Finally, the higher the Internet-use index, the more willingness to pay: -- (20%) 
compared to ++ (39%).  
 
Quite logically, the more they are exposed to data disclosure, the more likely 
respondents are to be willing to pay for access to their data.

3.2.2 Reasons for deleting personal data 
 
- 3/4 of Internet users want to be able to delete their personal data whenever they 
decide to do so - 
 
Respondents who use the Internet were asked under what circumstances, if any, they 
would like personal information stored and collected through a website to be 
completely deleted.31 
 
Three-quarters of Internet users want to delete this information whenever they decide 
to do so (75%), while far fewer say they want to do so when they stop using the 
website (24%) or when they change their Internet provider (13%). Clearly, the 
majority of European Internet users would want to claim ‘their right to be forgotten’.  
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample) 
 
A country-by-country breakdown shows that in every single Member State a 
majority want to delete personal information whenever they decide to, with the 
highest proportions in Malta (83%) and the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Sweden (all 
82%), and the lowest in the Netherlands (64%), Bulgaria (66%) and Italy (68%).   
 
The highest percentages saying they would like to delete their data when they stop 
using the service are found in Denmark (50%), Sweden (48%) and the Netherlands 
(43%); the lowest are recorded in Romania (11%) and Hungary (12%).

3.2.3 Importance of the portability of personal data across providers and 
platforms 
 
- More than seven in ten Internet users believe that it is important to be able to 
transfer personal data - 
 
Respondents who use the Internet were asked how important it was for them to be 
able to transfer personal information that was stored and collected through a website 
when they decide to change providers or stop using a service.32  A majority of 
European Internet users think this is important (71%), while a quarter say it is not 
(24%). 
 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample) 
 
A country-by-country analysis shows that in every EU Member State, a majority of 
respondents say that it is important to be able to transfer personal information when 
changing Internet providers or ceasing to using a service. The highest proportions are 
found in Greece (91%), Cyprus (90%) and Portugal (89%) and the lowest in 
Germany (53%), Sweden, and Denmark (each 56%).  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 161 - 
 
Base: Internet users (66% of whole sample) 
 
No socio-demographic differences were found, except that respondents aged 55+ 
(66%) and retired respondents (63%) are less likely to stress the importance of the 
portability of personal data.  
However, the level of Internet use does have some little impact on the answers given 
to this question. Social networking or sharing site users (both 75%) are more likely to 
think that the portability of personal data is important than those who are not 
involved in these activities (both 67%).

3.2.4 Incidence of changing privacy settings on social networking sites 
 
- More than half of social networking site users protect themselves on these 
websites - 
 
Respondents who use social networking or sharing sites were asked if they had ever 
tried to change the privacy settings on their personal profile from the default settings 
on a social networking site and/or sharing site.33 More than half of them had 
previously tried to change the privacy settings (51%), while almost half had not 
(46%). 
 
Base: Users of social networking or sharing sites (40% of whole sample) 
 
A country-by-country breakdown shows that users of social networking or sharing 
sites who reside in the UK (68%) were most likely to change the privacy settings on 
their personal profile, followed by those in the Nordic countries Finland (62%), 
Sweden (61%) and Denmark (59%), and also Estonia (60%). 
Conversely, this was least common in Bulgaria (33%) and the Czech Republic (35%).

A socio-demographic analysis shows that large differences exist between age 
groups and between different levels of education; occupation and finances are also 
influential, while gender is of less relevance here. The younger respondents are, and 
the longer they spent in education, the more likely they are to change their privacy 
settings, as are managers (57%) and students (64%) compared to 24% of retired 
respondents.

3.2.5 Ease of changing privacy settings on social network sites 
 
– A vast majority of social networking or sharing site users who tried to change 
their profiles found it easy – 
 
The large majority of respondents who use social networking or sharing sites and who 
had tried to change the privacy settings on their personal profiles found it easy 
(82%), compared with almost one-fifth who found it difficult.34 
 
 
Base: Users of social networking or sharing sites who tried to change privacy settings (20% of whole 
sample) 
 
A country by country analysis reveals that in every Member State, a majority of 
those who use social networking or sharing sites find it easy to change the privacy 
settings on their personal profiles, led by those in Cyprus (93%) and Lithuania and 
Bulgaria (92%); the lowest score was recorded in Austria (63%).

55+ (75%), respondents who have difficulties with paying their bills most of the time 
(76%) retired interviewees (73%), and managers (77%) are less likely to find it easy.  
 
It is interesting to note that the perceived level of control over data disclosed has an 
impact on the answers given to this question. Indeed, 91% of the social networking 
and sharing site users who say that that they have complete control over the data 
they disclose say that they find it easy to change their profile settings, compared with 
82% of those who feel that they have partial control and only 67% of those who say 
they have no control at all.

3.2.6  Reasons for not changing privacy settings on social network sites 
 
– Trust is the first reason mentioned for not changing privacy setting on social 
networking sites – 
 
Those respondents who use social networking or sharing sites and had not tried to 
change the privacy settings on their personal profile gave various reasons for not 
doing so.35 
 
The reason mentioned most frequently is that they trust the site to use appropriate 
privacy settings (28%). Furthermore, around one in five did not know that they could 
change the settings (23%), are not worried by having personal data on social 
networking or sharing sites (20%), or do not know how to change these settings 
(19%). Fewer say they have no time to look at the available options (12%).

Users of social networking or sharing sites who did not try to change the privacy 
settings on their personal profiles in Hungary (40%) are most likely to trust the site 
to set appropriate privacy settings. This was the main reason given by respondents in 
sixteen EU Member States.    
 
In six Member States, the main reason for not trying to change the privacy settings 
on personal profiles is that respondents did not know that they could change the 
settings. This is mentioned most frequently in the Czech Republic (38%) and Slovakia 
(35%). Note that in two countries, Italy and Latvia, this reason is mentioned as often 
as the first reason discussed above.   
 
In another six Member States, the most important reason is that respondents are not 
worried by having personal data on social networking and/or sharing sites, in 
particular in Denmark (35%) and Sweden (34%).  
 
Respondents in Estonia (36%) are most likely to say they do not know how to change 
these settings, and in Cyprus (28%) that they had no time to look at the available 
options.

3.3 Summary 
 
The aim of this chapter was to present Europeans’ opinions about various ways of 
protecting personal data, including their own identity management, their expectations 
of organisations holding personal data, and how they handle their own data.   
 
Europeans trust authorities and institutions to protect their personal data 
more than commercial companies. Of every ten Europeans interviewed, just under 
eight trust health and medical institutions, seven trust national public authorities such 
as tax and social security authorities, more than six trust banks and financial 
institutions, and more than five trust European institutions such as the European 
Commission and the European Parliament.  
 
However, fewer than four in ten Europeans trust shops and department stores, and 
less than one-third trust phone companies, mobile phone companies and Internet 
service providers. More than two in ten trust Internet companies such as search 
engines, social networking sites and e-mail services. 
 
Indeed, seven in ten Europeans are concerned that companies may use personal 
information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected without informing 
them (e.g. for direct marketing or targeted online advertising).  
 
Nearly three-quarters of Europeans say their approval should be required in all 
cases before any kind of personal information is collected and processed..  
 
Nearly nine in ten Europeans want to be informed by a public authority or by a 
private company if information held about them is lost or stolen. Less than one in 
three of Europeans are prepared to pay for access to their personal information 
stored by public or private entities.  
 
Three-quarters of European Internet users say that they would like personal data 
stored and collected through a website to be deleted whenever they decide to do so, 
while less than a quarter say they want to delete their personal data when they stop 
using a website or service. Even fewer respondents say they would like to delete their 
date when they change their Internet provider.  
 
More than seven out of ten European Internet users think it is important to be able to 
transfer personal information that was stored and collected through a website 
when they decide to change providers or stop using a service.  
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 173 - 
Just over half of the Europeans who use social networking or sharing sites tried to 
change the privacy settings from the default settings on their personal profile on a 
social networking site and/ or sharing site. More than eight out of ten of those who 
had tried found it easy to change the privacy settings of their personal profile.  
 
The reasons for not changing privacy settings are various. Almost one in three 
trust the site to set appropriate privacy settings; around one in five did not know that 
they could change the settings, are not worried by having personal data on social 
networking or sharing sites, or do not know how to go about changing these settings. 
One in eight say they had not found the time to look at the available options. 
 
Finally, young respondents and active Internet users are less likely to be concerned 
about their personal data handling than other socio-demographic categories.

4 REGULATION AND REMEDIES 
 
This chapter examines Europeans’ views on the regulatory protection of personal 
data. Firstly, their knowledge of the national Data Protection Authority in their country 
will be presented. Next, the general rules will be discussed, including the 
responsibility for the safe processing of personal data, the importance of equal data 
protection rights across the EU, at which level of administration rules should be 
enforced, the perceived effectiveness of Data Protection Officers in companies, and 
desired measures that should be imposed on companies that use people's data 
without their knowledge. The chapter will then discuss a few specific remedies: the 
special protection of genetic information, protecting and warning children, and police 
access to personal data.  
 
4.1 Knowledge of the national Data Protection Authority 
 
- The majority of Europeans have not heard  
of their national Data Protection Authority - 
 
The majority of the Europeans surveyed (63%) have not heard of any public authority 
responsible for protecting their rights regarding their personal data36. However, one-
third are aware of such an organisation (33%).

The countries with the largest proportions of interviewees who are aware of a public 
authority responsible for protecting their rights regarding their personal data are 
Hungary (51%), which is the only country where a majority have heard of this public 
authority, Slovenia (48%), and Greece (46%). Conversely, the smallest proportions 
were recorded in Spain (16%), Bulgaria (17%), and Austria (19%), Romania and 
Belgium (both 20%).

A socio-demographic breakdown reveals that interviewees who are aware of a 
national public authority responsible for protecting their rights regarding their 
personal data are more likely to be those who studied until the age of 20 or beyond 
(46%), self-employed respondents (40%), managers (54%), other white collar 
workers (39%), those who use the Internet every day (41%), and respondents who 
place themselves high on the social scale (42%).

4.2 General regulation 
 
4.2.1 Responsibility for safe handling of personal data 
 
4.2.1.1 On social networking and/or sharing sites 
 
- A majority of Internet users think that they should  
be responsible for the safe handling of personal data  
on social networking and/or sharing sites - 
 
Respondents who use social networking or sharing sites were asked who they think 
should make sure that their information is collected, stored and exchanged safely on 
these sites.37 
 
First, the interviewees were asked to name the first actor that should be responsible 
for the safe handling of personal data (Firstly?), with one answer only; then, they 
were asked for their second answer (Secondly?), also with one answer only. The 
answers to both parts of the question were combined to give an overall ranking. In 
this report, we focus on the results for the first responsible entity or person cited (first 
answer), but also on the combined result (total answers).  
Initially, half of the respondents point to themselves (49%), while one-third point to 
the social networking or sharing sites (33%). Even fewer identify the public 
authorities (16%).  
 
When the interviewees are given the opportunity to name a second responsible entity 
or person, the total results mention social networking or sharing sites (73%) and the 
respondents themselves (74%) almost equally; public authorities are cited much less 
(45%).

Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 178 - 
 
Base: Social Networking Sites users (40% of the whole sample) 
 
A country-by-country analysis of the first answers shows that in 23 of the 27 EU 
Member States, respondents primarily hold themselves responsible for the safe 
handling of personal data, most strikingly in Cyprus (68%), Ireland and Romania 
(both 65%), and Malta (64%); the lowest scores were recorded in Spain (37%) and 
Italy (38%).  
 
In the remaining four Member States, more or at least similar percentages of 
respondents point to social networking or sharing sites as hold themselves 
responsible: Denmark (49% and 41%), Finland (46% and 45%), the Czech Republic 
(44% and 42%), and Sweden (44% for both site types). Holding social networking or 
sharing sites responsible is reported least often in Romania, Malta, and Cyprus (all 
15%). 
 
Public authorities are not the primary entity held responsible in any of the Member 
States, though they were mentioned most often in Spain (33%), Greece (30%) and 
Italy (28%), three Mediterranean countries. Public authorities are least often held 
responsible for safe data handling in Ireland (7%) and the UK (8%); the Nordic

Base: Social Networking Sites users (40% of whole sample) 
 
A socio-demographic analysis reveals few differences between the different 
categories of respondents: retired people (53%) most often hold themselves 
responsible for the safe handling of data on social networking or sharing sites and 
students least often (45%). Conversely, students (37%) are most inclined to hold the 
social networking or sharing sites responsible, compared with retired respondents 
(22%) and respondents aged 55+ (25%). The highest percentages holding the public 
authorities responsible are found amongst the oldest group aged 55+ (21%), self-
employed respondents, and retired respondents (both 20%). Respondents in all 
categories think that they themselves should have the first responsibility for the safe 
handling of data.

4.2.1.2 On shopping sites 
 
- Online shoppers hold the shopping sites at least as responsible as 
themselves - 
 
When respondents who use shopping sites are asked who they think should make 
sure that their information is collected, stored and exchanged safely when they buy 
goods or services on the Internet38, their first reaction is that they hold themselves 
responsible almost equally often as the online shopping sites (41% and 39% 
respectively); public authorities are mentioned much less (19%).      
 
Naming a second responsible entity or person, the total result is that the online 
shopping sites (76%) are held responsible even more often than the interviewees 
themselves (67%). Public authorities are mentioned least (51%). This result is 
different from that obtained for social network sites, where the respondents hold 
themselves and the sites equally responsible, and the public authorities much less so. 
Hence, online shoppers are much more likely than social networkers to mandate 
responsibility to public authorities.

Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 181 - 
A country-by-country analysis of the first answers generally reveals a similar 
pattern as for social networking. The countries with highest percentages holding users 
themselves responsible for the safe handling of data are Ireland (61%), Portugal 
(59%), Malta (58%), Cyprus (57%) and Romania (55%) whereas the lowest 
percentages are found in Spain (29%), the Czech Republic and Italy (each 32%),and 
the Nordic countries Sweden (23%), Denmark (25%), and Finland (32%). 
In turn, the Nordic countries Sweden (64%), Denmark (62%), and Finland (58%) 
stand out for most often citing the shopping sites, compared to Romania (23%), 
Malta (25%) and Cyprus (26%). Public authorities are mentioned most often in Italy 
(37%), Spain (34%), Greece (31%) compared to Slovenia (4%), Bulgaria (5%), 
Ireland (7%), the UK, Finland, and Estonia (all 9%).   
 
A socio-demographic breakdown shows that gender, age, education, occupation, 
and financial situation are of influence. Women are more likely than men to hold the 
shopping sites responsible (42% versus 36%), but they are less likely to mention 
public authorities (16% versus 21%). The youngest respondents, those aged 15-24, 
hold the shopping sites responsible more often than respondents aged 55+ (43% 
versus 34%), but are less likely to mention the public authorities (15% versus 21%). 
Respondents who left school at the age of 15 or younger (35%) are less likely to hold 
the shopping sites responsible than interviewees who spent longer in education. 
Turning to occupation, manual workers (47%) and retired respondents (46%) more 
often hold themselves responsible than white collar workers (35%), unemployed 
respondents (36%) and students (37%). The latter two groups in turn are more likely 
to mention shopping sites (47% and 45% respectively) than retired respondents 
(31%). House persons (19%) are the least likely of all occupational groups to point to 
public authorities. Finally respondents who have difficulties with paying their bills 
most of the time tend to point more to the shopping sites (44%) and less to public 
authorities (15%) than those without such difficulties 
 
 
4.2.2 Importance of harmonised protection rights across EU 
 
- An immense majority of Europeans are in favour of having the same rights 
and protection over their personal information in all EU countries - 
 
Nine out of ten of the Europeans surveyed (90%) think it is important for them to 
have the same rights and protection over their personal information, regardless of the 
EU country in which it is collected and processed; while only a small minority (7%) 
think it is not important.39

4.2.3 Desired administrative level for the enforcement of rules 
 
- A relative majority of Europeans believe that rules should be enforced at 
European level - 
 
Asked about the administrative level at which personal data protection rules should be 
enforced, more than four in ten Europeans surveyed opt for the European level 
(44%), while a somewhat smaller number prefer the national level (40%); only one in 
ten mention the regional or local level (10%).40 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
A country-by-country analysis shows that most respondents choose the European 
level in Latvia (58%), Luxembourg (57%), Germany (56%), and France (56%). It is 
the first response in 15 Member States. In contrast, it is mentioned least in the 
western European countries the UK (17%) and Ireland (26%); in Slovenia (27%); 
and in the Nordic countries Sweden (20%), Denmark (27%) and Finland (33%).  
 
Instead, the Nordic countries have among the highest percentages of respondents 
preferring the national level for the enforcement of personal data protection rules: 
Sweden (66%), Denmark (60%) and Finland (53%), together with Slovenia (59%), 
the UK (61%) and Ireland (52%).  
 
The UK and Ireland are also the Member States with the highest percentages of 
interviewees who want a regional or local level of enforcement: Ireland (15%) and 
the UK (16%), closely followed by Austria (17%). This level was mentioned least in 
the Netherlands (5%).

A socio-demographic analysis reveals several differences regarding age, education, 
household composition, occupation, and Internet use. Gender is of minor importance, 
with slightly more men (47%) than women (43%) preferring the enforcement of 
personal data protection rules at the European level. In general, the older, the more 
highly educated and the more active on the Internet respondents are, the more likely 
they are to opt for the European level. These categories are often also more in favour 
of the European Union, for all other topics addressed.

4.2.4 Perceived effectiveness of Data Protection Officers in companies 
 
- A majority of Europeans believe that a Data Protection Officer in companies 
would make things better - 
 
Almost two-third (64%) of respondents think that their data would be better 
protected in large companies if these companies were obliged to have a specific 
contact person in charge of ensuring that people’s personal data is handled 
properly41. However, over a quarter (27%) disagrees. The remaining 9% ‘don’t know’.  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID

Base: Whole sample 
 
A country-by-country analysis shows that in every single Member State at least half 
of the interviewees believe a specific contact person would ensure better data 
protection. The countries with the largest proportions of respondents who agree with 
this proposal are Finland (79%), Hungary (76%), the UK (76%), and Estonia and 
Ireland (both 73%). These countries, as we saw in the preceding section, are also 
most in favour of regulation at a national level - though less emphatically in the case 
of Hungary. They are also countries with relatively smaller proportions of respondents 
who disagree. Rather large minorities of the latter, however, are found in Germany 
(44%), the Netherlands (39%), Denmark (36%), the Czech Republic (34%), and 
Belgium and France (32%).

A socio-demographic breakdown reveals that age, education, occupation and 
internet activity are all of relevance. In general, the younger and the more highly 
educated respondents are, the more likely they are to agree that special contact 
persons in companies will lead to better data protection. Furthermore, students and 
unemployed people are more likely to have this opinion, in particular when compared 
to retired interviewees.  
However, it should be noted that the groups least inclined to think a Data Protection 
Officer would be effective in large companies, namely the oldest, the less educated, 
and retired people, are also the groups who most often say they don’t know.

4.2.5 Sanctions for breaches of data protection rights  
 
- Imposing a fine on companies that use people’s data without their 
knowledge should be the first priority of the public authorities - 
 
Some companies use people’s personal data without their knowledge, creating 
inconvenience ranging from spam to financial loss. Respondents were asked what 
they thought the public authorities’ main priorities for tackling these practices should 
be; they were asked to choose four from the 12 priorities presented42. 
 
 
Base: Whole sample 
 
Over half of the Europeans surveyed say a fine should be imposed on these 
companies (51%). Four out of ten think such companies should be banned from using 
such data in the future (40%), or compelled to compensate the victims (39%).  
 
Around three out of ten respondents are of the opinion that public authorities should 
find a better technical solution that preserves users' privacy and safety (30%),

provide legal support for those willing to take the case in court (29%), or give people 
more direct control over their own personal data (28%).  
 
Around one in five interviewees say public authorities ought to raise awareness of the 
implications of unsafe disclosure (22%), make greater use of warnings and signs to 
signal possible unsafe disclosure (19%), or allocate more resources to monitoring and 
enforcing existing regulations (18%).  
 
One in ten believe public authorities should provide formal education and guidelines 
on safe disclosure (11%), provide an out of court procedure to sort out the problem 
(10%), or put people in a similar situation in touch to start joint legal action (10%).  
 
A country-by-country analysis reveals that imposing a fine on these companies is 
the most important priority in 22 of the 27 Member States. It is mentioned most often 
in Slovenia (76%), Cyprus (73%), Ireland and Romania (63%), but least often in 
Finland (35%) and Austria (38%).  
 
Absolute majorities in Cyprus (66%) and Bulgaria (58%) think that companies should 
be banned from using such data in the future, whereas fewer than one-third agree in 
Poland (30%) and Malta (25%). This priority is the first cited by respondents in 
Luxembourg (48%) and Finland (39%), equally with give people more direct control 
on their own personal data). 
 
Compelling companies to compensate the victims receives the most mentions in 
Bulgaria (55%), Sweden (49%) and Portugal (48%), and the least in Finland (28%) 
and the United Kingdom (31%).

A socio-demographic analysis reveals almost no differences with respect to the top 
three priorities. Nevertheless, a similar general pattern was found for age, education, 
and occupation (but not gender) in five of the nine remaining priorities. These are to 
find a better technical solution that preserves users' privacy and safety; to give 
people more direct control over their own personal data; to raise awareness of the 
implications of unsafe disclosure; to make greater use of warnings and signs to signal 
possible unsafe disclosure; and to allocate more resources to monitoring and 
enforcing existing regulations. 
 
This general pattern is as follows. The respondents who left school at the age of 15 or 
younger, house persons, retired people, interviewees who have difficulties with paying 
their bills most of the time, respondents who place themselves low on the social 
scale, and interviewees with IA index - - , are less likely to mention all five priorities. 
In contrast, managers or other white collar workers tend to mention these priorities 
more often, as do active Internet users. These priorities are perhaps perceived as 
quite technical or abstract and therefore are less selected by less privileged groups.

4.3 Rules on specific categories of personal data 
  
4.3.1 Special protection of genetic information 
 
- The vast majority of Europeans want genetic data to have the same special 
protection as data on health, sex life, ethnicity,  
religion and political opinions - 
 
EU data protection rules nowadays provide for special protection for the processing of 
sensitive personal data, such as data related to health, sex life, ethnic origin, religious 
beliefs, political opinions, etc. The vast majority (88%) of Europeans surveyed think 
that genetic information such as DNA data should also have the same special 
protection, while only 7% say it should not.43

special protection? 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 195 - 
A country-by-country analysis shows that vast majorities in every single Member 
States agree that DNA data should have special protection. These majorities are 
largest in Slovakia (96%), Greece (95%), and Cyprus and Slovenia (94%) and 
smallest in Romania (80%) and Lithuania (78%). Lithuania also has one of the 
highest proportions of people who disagree (10%), along with Finland, Italy, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg and Sweden (all 10%), and to an even greater extent Belgium 
and Denmark (both 13%).

A socio-demographic breakdown shows a few differences regarding age, education, 
occupation, and Internet use. Respondents aged 55+ (84%) are least likely of all age 
groups to say that genetic data should have special protection. Respondents who 
were educated until the age of 20 or beyond (93%) are more likely to want special 
protection for genetic data than those who left school at the age of 15 or younger 
(82%); as do managers (94%) more than retired respondents (83%), and active 
Internet users ++ (93%) more than less active users - - (84%). 
Despite these small differences, the main finding is that large majorities agree that 
genetic information such as DNA data should have the same special protection as 
other sensitive personal data, such as data related to health, sex life, ethnic origin, 
religious beliefs, or political opinions.  
 
 
4.3.2 Protecting and warning minors 
 
- Almost all Europeans agree that minors should be protected from and 
warned against disclosure of personal data - 
 
Strongly convinced as they are that genetic information should have the same special 
protection as other sensitive information, the Europeans surveyed are even more 
convinced that minors should be specially protected from the collection and disclosure 
of personal data (95%) and also that minors should be warned of the consequences 
of collecting and disclosing personal data (96%).44

A country-by-country analysis shows these opinions are shared by vast majorities 
in all EU Member States. The lowest proportions are found in Italy (91% for each 
statement), the country which also has the largest proportion of respondents who 
disagree (7% for each statement).  
A socio-demographic breakdown did not reveal any differences between groups, 
except that the youngest respondents (aged 15 to 24) agree less emphatically: they 
answer ‘totally agree’ slightly less than the other age groups, maybe because some of 
them are minors themselves.  
 
There is a consensus in European public opinion on these ideas: minors should be 
specially protected from the collection and disclosure of personal data, and they 
should be warned against the possible consequences that may follow disclosure. 
 
 
4.3.3 Police access to personal data 
 
- Europeans’ opinions are divided on the circumstances  
for police access to personal data - 
 
The police sometimes access and analyse individuals' personal data to carry out their 
activities. Respondents were asked in what circumstances the police should be able to 
access individuals' personal data.45 
 
Responses are quite varied on this issue. While one-third (33%) of the Europeans 
surveyed say the police should be able to access personal data for all general crime 
prevention activities, a somewhat larger proportion (37%) think the police should be 
allowed to do so only with regard to specific data in connection with a specific 
investigation, and a quarter (26%) say the authorisation of a judge should be 
required.

Most mentions of all general crime interventions are found in Romania (41%) and 
Italy (40%), but also in Spain, Latvia, the UK (37% each) and in Malta (35%): except 
in the UK, it is the first answer cited in these Member States. Respondents in Estonia 
(17%), Lithuania (18%) and Austria (21%) are the least likely to give this response.  
The authorisation of a judge is mentioned most often in Cyprus and Slovenia (both 
40%, first answer cited), and least often in Finland (13%) and Italy (18%). It is also 
the first response in France and Luxembourg (38% in both countries). 
Some of the variations between countries in this matter of a delicate balance between 
citizens’ safety and their privacy may well reflect historical and cultural differences.

(28%) to approve police access to personal data for all general crime prevention 
activities. House persons (37%) cite this item more often than managers (28%).  
 
In connection with a specific investigation is most likely to be mentioned by managers 
(42%), other white collar workers (41%), students (41%), and active Internet users 
++ (42%), and least by unemployed (32%) and retired respondents (33%).  
 
More men (29%) than women (24%) think a judge’s authorisation should be 
required, and so do more of the respondents who were educated until the age of 20 
or beyond (30%), unemployed interviewees (32%), respondents who have difficulties 
with paying their bills most of the time (31%), and moderately active Internet users – 
(30%). Further, interviewees who place themselves to the left of the political 
spectrum (32%) are more likely to want a judge’s authorisation before the police may 
access personal data than respondents who are placed more to the right (23%).

4.4 Summary 
 
The aim of this chapter was to gain insight into Europeans’ wishes regarding the 
regulatory protection of personal data.  
 
Only one-third of Europeans are aware of the existence of a national public 
authority responsible for protecting their rights regarding their personal data. 
 
Three-quarters of the Europeans who use social networking or sharing sites think they 
themselves are responsible for safe data handling, that is for the safe collection, 
storage and exchange of their information on these sites. Nonetheless, an equal 
proportion also think that these sites should take responsibility.  
 
The proportion of online shoppers who think that online shopping sites should be 
responsible (three-quarters) outnumbers those who feel they should be personally 
responsible (two-thirds).  
 
Nine out of ten of the Europeans surveyed say it is important for them to have 
harmonised protection and rights across the EU with respect to personal data, 
regardless of the EU country in which it is collected and processed. 
 
Asked about the desired administrative level of enforcement of regulation on 
personal data protection, more than four Europeans in ten say they prefer the 
European level, while a somewhat smaller number prefer the national level; only one 
in ten mention a regional or local level. 
 
Almost two-thirds of Europeans believe their personal data would be better protected 
in large companies if these companies were obliged to have a Data Protection 
Officer in charge of ensuring that people’s personal data is handled properly while 
over a quarter disagree.  
 
The sanctions which Europeans would like for companies that use people’s data 
without their knowledge are as follows. Half of the respondents say that a fine 
should be imposed on companies. Four out of ten think such companies should be 
banned from using such data in the future, or compelled to compensate the victims. 
Three out of ten say that public authorities should find better technical solutions that 
preserve users' privacy and safety, provide legal support for those willing to take the 
case in court, or give people more direct control over their own personal data. Other 
sanctions are mentioned by less than a quarter of Europeans.  
 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 203 - 
Close to nine out of ten Europeans also think that genetic information such as DNA 
data should have the same special protection as data related to health, sex life, ethnic 
origin, religious beliefs, and political opinions.  
 
Almost all Europeans believe that under-age children should be specially 
protected from the collection and disclosure of personal data and also that minors 
should be warned of the consequences of collecting and disclosing personal data.  
 
Europeans are rather guarded in considering the circumstances under which 
police should access individuals’ personal data. While one-third say the police 
should be able to access personal data for all general crime prevention activities, a 
somewhat larger proportion think the police should be given such access only with 
regard to specific data required within a specific investigation. Furthermore, a quarter 
say the authorisation of a judge should be required.

CONCLUSION 
 
In the light of the ever-increasing role digital technologies have played in society 
during the last decade, enabling the unprecedented large-scale collection, storage and 
processing of personal data, the purpose of this study was to gain insight into 
Europeans’ disclosure of personal information, with a special focus on the Internet. 
More specifically, this report addresses Europeans’ actual disclosure of personal 
information, their awareness of and perceived control over their personal data, their 
ways of protecting personal data, and the data protection regulation they would like 
to see. Insights into these issues can help develop regulation and tailor it to 
Europeans’ specific needs and vulnerabilities with respect to personal data protection. 
 
Throughout the report two types of Internet users were distinguished: users of social 
networking sites or sharing sites for photos, videos and movies on the one hand and 
users of e-commerce sites for purchasing goods or services on the other. 
Furthermore, there has been a particular focus in this report on identifying ‘digital 
natives’. A digital native can be defined as a young person who was born during or 
after the general introduction of digital technology, and through interacting with 
digital technology from an early age, has a greater understanding of its concepts.  
 
Disclosure of personal information 
A majority of the Europeans see disclosing personal information as an increasing part 
of modern life. Information considered as personal is, above all, financial information, 
medical information, and national identity numbers (or card or passport); also 
fingerprints, home address, and mobile phone number are mentioned by more than 
half of Europeans.  
 
Europeans’ actual online disclosure of personal information mainly involves their 
names, home addresses, mobile numbers, nationalities – and for online shoppers also 
financial information. The most important reason for disclosure is to access an online 
service. More than four in ten Internet users report that they have been asked for 
more personal information than necessary when they intended to obtain access to or 
use an online service, resulting in considerable concern among those who had had 
this experience.  
 
Turning to Europeans’ concern about disclosure of personal information, around half 
are concerned about their behaviour being recorded via payment cards, or via mobile 
phone or mobile Internet; around four in ten worry about being recorded in a private 
space, or being tracked via store or loyalty cards, or on the Internet. Over half of the 
Internet users feel uncomfortable with profiling on the Internet. The most significant 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 205 - 
risks associated with disclosure on the Internet are being a victim of fraud 
(particularly by online shoppers), having one’s information used without one’s 
knowledge, and having one’s information shared with third parties without one’s 
agreement. Online identity theft and information being used to send unwanted 
commercial offers were also mentioned, though less often. All in all, Europeans 
appear to be fairly concerned about their privacy. 
 
Awareness of and perceived control over personal data 
Identity management concerns not least the type of credentials Europeans use: 
mostly credit cards and bank cards, national identity cards or residence permits, 
government entitlement cards, or driving licences. One-third of respondents have an 
account they use on the Internet, such as email, or for social networking or 
commercial services. To protect their identity in daily life, Europeans use passive 
strategies, such as withholding personal information, more than active strategies, 
where one takes action. To protect their identity on the Internet, the most common 
strategies are technical or procedural, such as tools and strategies to limit unwanted 
emails and spam, and to check that a transaction is protected or that the site has a 
safety logo or label, and the use of anti-spy software; whereas the less frequent 
methods involve some kind of individual initiative on the part of the internet user, 
such as maintaining awareness through search engines.  
 
Turning to Europeans’ awareness of their personal data possibly being accessible to 
third parties, almost six in ten Internet users usually read privacy statements and the 
majority of those who read them adapt their Internet behaviour. However, almost 
three in ten Internet users report that they are rarely or never informed about the 
conditions for data collection and the further uses of their data when they want to join 
a social networking site or register for a service online. In particular almost half of 
users say that social networking or sharing sites do not provide sufficient information 
about the possible consequences of disclosing personal information. 
 
A majority of the interviewees who had disclosed information on the Internet feel 
partly or completely in control of their personal data; just over a quarter of social 
network users and even fewer online shoppers feel in complete control.  
 
Protection of personal data 
Europeans’ expectations of organisations regarding the protection of personal data 
vary. Authorities and institutions – including the European Commission and the 
European Parliament – are trusted more than commercial companies. Less than one-
third trust phone companies, mobile phone companies and Internet service providers; 
and just over one-fifth trust Internet companies such as search engines, social 
networking sites and e-mail services. A majority of Europeans are concerned that 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 206 - 
their personal data held by companies may be used for a different purpose than that 
for which it was collected, and say their approval should always be required for any 
personal data handling, besides wanting to be informed if such data are lost or stolen. 
Those who distrust the public authorities regarding the protection of personal 
information are also more likely to feel no control at all over the personal information 
they disclose on social networking and sharing sites whereas this impression is less 
widespread among those who trust the public authorities. 
 
Turning to Europeans’ own data handling, less than one-third are prepared to pay for 
access to their personal information stored by public or private entities. A majority of 
Internet users believe it important to be able to transfer personal data, and over half 
of social network users tried to change the privacy settings on their personal profile 
from the default setting. 
 
Regulation on personal data protection 
Only one-third of Europeans are aware of the existence of a national Data Protection 
Authority responsible for protecting their rights regarding their personal data. Even 
though a majority of the European Internet users feel responsible themselves for the 
safe handling of their personal data, almost all Europeans do favour harmonised 
protection rights across the EU. More than four in ten Europeans prefer the European 
level of administration to enforce regulation, while a somewhat smaller number prefer 
the national level.  
 
Regarding the type of regulation aimed at companies to prevent them from using 
people’s personal data without their knowledge, Europeans mainly think that such 
companies should be fined, banned from using such data in the future, or compelled 
to compensate the victims. A majority believe that their personal data would be 
better protected in large companies if these companies were obliged to have a Data 
Protection Officer.  
 
Europeans’ opinions are divided with respect to the circumstances under which police 
should have access to personal data. In contrast, they almost all agree that minors 
should be protected from and warned against the disclosure of personal data; and are 
in favour of the special protection of genetic data.

Countries of interest 
? A general pattern – with few exceptions – emerged, with northern and western 
European countries having relatively more online shoppers, while users of 
social networking or sharing sites tend to be more common in the southern 
and eastern countries.    
? Over-disclosure of personal information is experienced most often by Internet 
users residing in the southern European countries, notably Portugal, Spain, 
Italy, Hungary and Greece but also in Ireland. 
? The countries with the largest percentages of online shoppers and social 
networking site users who do not feel in control over their personal data are 
also the countries where the fewest interviewees feel sufficiently informed by 
these sites about the possible consequences of disclosing personal information. 
This is most notable in Germany and France.   
? Trust in institutions, authorities and companies holding personal data is 
weakest in Greece, Romania and Poland.  
 
Digital natives and digital initiates 
Two types of digital experts emerged from the survey. Firstly, as expected, the ‘digital 
natives’: young persons born during or after the general introduction of digital 
technology. Secondly, another group emerged, ‘digital initiates’: they are not of that 
age by definition, but have become experienced by interacting with digital technology 
e.g. through work or education, and have different viewpoints from digital natives.  
? Digital natives are born and raised with digital technology: they are the 
younger Europeans aged 15-24, and students. These groups appeared to 
stand out with respect to a large number of issues addressed in this survey. 
They are the most likely to agree that disclosing personal information is not a 
big issue for them, that they do not mind disclosing personal information in 
return for free services online, such as a free email address, and that they feel 
obliged to disclose personal information on the Internet. They are also the 
most likely to disclose various types of personal information on social 
networking sites; to disclose personal information on social networking sites 
‘for fun’; to usually not read privacy statements on the Internet, but to feel 
sufficiently informed about the conditions for data collection and the further 
uses of their data when joining a social networking site or registering for a 
service online; to trust all authorities, institutions and commercial companies; 
to have changed their personal profile from the default settings on a social 
networking site or sharing site; and to hold the social networking or sharing 
sites responsible for safe handling of data. 
 
Conversely, digital natives are the least likely to say that there is a risk that 
their information may be used to send them unwanted commercial offers; to 
say that websites will not honour their privacy statements; to protect their 
Special Eurobarometer 359  DP + e-ID 
- 208 - 
identity, either in daily life or on the Internet; or to be concerned about the 
personal information held by companies being used for a purpose other than 
that for which it was collected. 
 
? Digital initiates are familiar with the Internet through their work or higher 
education rather than because of their age. In occupational terms, they are 
likely to be managers. In contrast to digital natives, they have considerable 
concerns, as reflected by their surprisingly deviating viewpoints on several 
issues.  
They are the least likely to think that disclosing personal information is not a 
big issue for them, and they feel the least often in control of their personal 
data, e.g. the ability to change, delete or correct this information, when 
shopping online as well as when using social networking sites. 
In contrast, they are most likely to protect their identity in daily life and on the 
Internet, and in most various ways; managers are most likely to be prepared 
to pay for access to personal information stored by public or private entities; 
and to have changed the privacy settings on their personal profile from the 
default settings on a social networking or sharing site.  
 
In general, although the majority of Europeans have accepted the disclosure of 
personal information as fact of modern life, they appear to be quite concerned about 
their privacy. Substantial proportions of Europeans appear to be in need of 
information on personal data. Reading privacy statements on the Internet is proven to 
change their behaviour.  
 
Therefore, informing Europeans about personal data can help to raise awareness and 
persuade them to be more cautious when disclosing personal information. More than 
half of respondents trust European institutions such as the European Commission and 
the European Parliament regarding the protection of personal data. Almost all 
Europeans favour harmonised protection rights across the EU and a relative majority 
would prefer regulation to be enforced at the European level of administration.

SPECIAL EUROBAROMETER 359 
 
“Attitudes on Data Protection and Electronic Identity in the European Union” 
 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
 
Between the 25th of November and the 17th of December 2010, TNS Opinion & Social, a consortium created between TNS plc and TNS opinion, carried 
out the wave 74.3 of the EUROBAROMETER, on request of the EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Directorate-General for Communication, “Research and 
Speechwriting”. 
 
The SPECIAL EUROBAROMETER 359 is part of wave 74.3 and covers the population of the respective nationalities of the European Union Member 
States, resident in each of the Member States and aged 15 years and over. The basic sample design applied in all states is a multi-stage, random 
(probability) one. In each country, a number of sampling points was drawn with probability proportional to population size (for a total coverage of the 
country) and to population density. 
 
In order to do so, the sampling points were drawn systematically from each of the "administrative regional units", after stratification by individual unit 
and type of area. They thus represent the whole territory of the countries surveyed according to the EUROSTAT NUTS II (or equivalent) and according 
to the distribution of the resident population of the respective nationalities in terms of metropolitan, urban and rural areas. In each of the selected 
sampling points, a starting address was drawn, at random. Further addresses (every Nth address) were selected by standard "random route" 
procedures, from the initial address. In each household, the respondent was drawn, at random (following the "closest birthday rule"). All interviews 
were conducted face-to-face in people's homes and in the appropriate national language. As far as the data capture is concerned, CAPI (Computer 
Assisted Personal Interview) was used in those countries where this technique was available.

For each country a comparison between the sample and the universe was carried out. The Universe description was derived from Eurostat population 
data or from national statistics offices. For all countries surveyed, a national weighting procedure, using marginal and intercellular weighting, was 
carried out based on this Universe description. In all countries, gender, age, region and size of locality were introduced in the iteration procedure. For 
international weighting (i.e. EU averages), TNS Opinion & Social applies the official population figures as provided by EUROSTAT or national statistic 
offices. The total population figures for input in this post-weighting procedure are listed above. 
 
Readers are reminded that survey results are estimations, the accuracy of which, everything being equal, rests upon the sample size and upon the 
observed percentage.  With samples of about 1,000 interviews, the real percentages vary within the following confidence limits: 
 
 
Observed percentages 10% or 90% 20% or 80% 30% or 70% 40% or 60% 50% 
Confidence limits ± 1.9 points ± 2.5 points ± 2.7 points ± 3.0 points ± 3.1 points

QB21 Comme vous le savez peut-être, certaines sociétés Internet ont la possibilité de fournir des moteurs de recherche 
gratuits ou des comptes e-mails gratuits grâce aux revenus que leur apportent les publicitaires qui essaient d’atteindre les 
utilisateurs sur leurs sites web. Dans quelle mesure êtes-vous à l’aise avec l’idée que ces sites web utilisent des informations 
sur vos activités en ligne pour adapter les publicités ou le contenu à vos loisirs et à vos centres d’intérêt ? 
QB21 As you may know, some Internet companies are able to provide free search engines or free e-mail accounts thanks to 
the income they receive from advertisers trying to reach users on their websites. How comfortable are you with the fact that 
those websites use information about your online activity to tailor advertisements or content to your hobbies and interests?

QB21 Wie Sie vielleicht wissen, sind einige Internetfirmen in der Lage, kostenlose Suchmaschinen oder kostenlose E-Mail-
Konten anzubieten. Dies ist dank der Einnahmen möglich, die sie von Werbetreibenden erhalten, die versuchen, die Nutzer 
auf den Webseiten dieser Firmen zu erreichen. Wie wohl fühlen Sie sich mit der Tatsache, dass diese Webseiten 
Informationen über Ihre Online-Aktivitäten nutzen, um Werbeanzeigen oder Inhalte gezielt auf Ihre Hobbys und Interessen
